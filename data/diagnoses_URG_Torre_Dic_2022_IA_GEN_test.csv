Fracture of the Right Hand: The patient's symptoms align with this diagnosis. He has experienced trauma to his right hand during a sports activity, which has resulted in pain and swelling. The physical examination reveals swelling of the soft tissues and pain in the 2-4th metacarpal bones of the right hand. The X-ray of the right hand confirms a diaphyseal fracture of the 3rd metacarpal bone. There are no symptoms that do not align with this diagnosis.

+2. Soft Tissue Injury: This could be a potential diagnosis as the patient has swelling and pain in the right hand, which are common symptoms of a soft tissue injury. However, the X-ray confirms a fracture, which is not a symptom of a soft tissue injury.

+3. Sprained Wrist: This could be a potential diagnosis as the patient has experienced trauma to his hand. However, the patient's wrist mobility is preserved and painless, which does not align with the symptoms of a sprained wrist. The X-ray also confirms a fracture in the hand, not the wrist.

+4. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: This is a less likely diagnosis as it typically results from repetitive hand movements, not trauma. The patient does not have symptoms such as tingling, numbness, or weakness in the hand, which are common in carpal tunnel syndrome.

+5. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: This is a rare condition that can occur after an injury, where the patient experiences severe pain and swelling. However, this is less likely as the patient's symptoms have occurred immediately after the trauma, whereas symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome usually develop gradually."
