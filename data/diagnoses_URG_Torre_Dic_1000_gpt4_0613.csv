Common Cold: This is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, cough with expectoration, and sternal pain during coughing fits are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have a fever, which is often associated with a common cold.

+2. Bronchitis: This is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. The patient's symptoms of cough with expectoration and the increase in bronchovascular pattern on the right side seen in the chest X-ray are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have shortness of breath, which is often associated with bronchitis.

+3. Pneumonia: This is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. The patient's symptoms of cough with expectoration could be consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have a fever, difficulty breathing, or infiltrates on the chest X-ray, which are often associated with pneumonia.

+4. Asthma: This is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. The patient's symptoms of cough with expectoration could be consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have wheezing or shortness of breath, which are often associated with asthma.

+5. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): This is a chronic condition where stomach acid frequently flows back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus). This backward flow (acid reflux) can irritate the lining of your esophagus and cause a chronic cough. The patient's symptoms of cough with expectoration and sternal pain during coughing fits could be consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have heartburn or regurgitation, which are often associated with GERD."

Migraine: This is a neurological condition that can cause multiple symptoms. It's frequently characterized by intense, debilitating headaches. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, difficulty speaking, numbness or tingling, and sensitivity to light and sound. The patient's symptoms of headache (cefalea) align with this diagnosis, but she does not report sensitivity to light or sound, or nausea.

+2. Gastroenteritis: This is an inflammation of the lining of the intestines caused by a virus, bacteria or parasites. Viral gastroenteritis is often referred to as stomach flu. Symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally fever. The patient's abdominal pain could suggest this, but she does not report vomiting, diarrhea, or fever.

+3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): This is an infection in any part of your urinary system — your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra. Symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen, a strong persistent urge to urinate, a burning sensation when urinating, and fever. The patient's lower abdominal pain could suggest this, but she denies urinary symptoms and does not have a fever.

+4. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID): This is an infection of the female reproductive organs. It usually occurs when sexually transmitted bacteria spread from your vagina to your uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries. Symptoms include pain in your lower abdomen, fever, an unusual discharge with a bad odor from your vagina, pain and/or bleeding when you have sex, burning sensation when you urinate, and bleeding between periods. The patient's lower abdominal pain could suggest this, but she does not report any of the other symptoms.

+5. Appendicitis: This is an inflammation of the appendix, a finger-shaped pouch that projects from your colon on the lower right side of your abdomen. Appendicitis causes pain in your lower right abdomen. However, in most people, pain begins around the navel and then moves. As inflammation worsens, appendicitis pain typically increases and eventually becomes severe. The patient's lower abdominal pain could suggest this, but the pain is not localized to the lower right side."

Pharyngitis: This is an inflammation of the pharynx, which is in the back of the throat. It's most often referred to simply as ""sore throat."" Symptoms include sore throat, fever, and cough. The patient's symptoms of intense odynophagia (painful swallowing), fever, and dry cough are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have any exudates on the tonsils, which is often seen in pharyngitis.

+2. Tonsillitis: This is an inflammation of the tonsils, two oval-shaped pads of tissue at the back of the throat — one tonsil on each side. Signs and symptoms of tonsillitis include sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and tender lymph nodes on the sides of the neck. The patient's symptoms of painful swallowing and fever could suggest tonsillitis, but the examination shows normal tonsils without exudates, which is not typical for tonsillitis.

+3. Laryngitis: This is an inflammation of your voice box (larynx) from overuse, irritation or infection. Symptoms can include sore throat, dry cough, and difficulty swallowing. The patient's symptoms of painful swallowing and dry cough could suggest laryngitis, but the patient does not report any voice changes, which are common in laryngitis.

+4. Esophagitis: This is an inflammation that may damage tissues of the esophagus, the muscular tube that delivers food from your mouth to your stomach. Esophagitis can cause painful swallowing. The patient's symptom of painful swallowing could suggest esophagitis, but the patient does not report any chest pain, which is often associated with esophagitis.

+5. Viral Upper Respiratory Infection: This is a type of infection that primarily affects the nose and throat and is caused by a variety of viruses. Symptoms can include sore throat, cough, and fever. The patient's symptoms of painful swallowing, dry cough, and fever could suggest a viral upper respiratory infection. However, the patient's COVID-19 test is negative, which rules out one common cause of viral upper respiratory infections."
