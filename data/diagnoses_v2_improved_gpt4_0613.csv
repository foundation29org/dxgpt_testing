+3 Chronic Hypertension: The patient's history of high blood pressure and similar complications in previous pregnancies could indicate this condition. 

+4 HELLP Syndrome: This is a severe form of preeclampsia that includes hemolysis (H), elevated liver enzymes (EL), and low platelet count (LP). The patient's sharp abdominal pain could be due to liver involvement. However, the patient did not report any symptoms of hemolysis or low platelet count. 

+5 Placental Insufficiency: This condition, which can lead to IUGR, could be suggested by the abnormal blood flow in the umbilical artery. However, the patient did not report any symptoms of vaginal bleeding or rapid uterine contractions, which are often associated with this condition."
Fragile X syndrome,"+1 Fragile X Syndrome: The patient's developmental delays, behavioral issues, physical features, and autistic-like behaviors are all consistent with this genetic disorder. However, the patient did not report any seizures, which can occur in some individuals with FXS.

+2 Autism Spectrum Disorder: The developmental delays and autistic-like behaviors fit with ASD. However, the physical features described are not typically associated with this condition.

+3 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: The hyperactivity and difficulty focusing attention could suggest ADHD. However, this wouldn't account for the physical features or the full range of autistic-like behaviors.

+4 Generalized Anxiety Disorder: The patient's anxiety and difficulty focusing could be symptoms of this condition. However, it doesn't explain the developmental delays or physical features.

+3 Eisenmenger Syndrome: The patient's cyanosis, rapid heartbeat, and heart enlargement are consistent with this diagnosis. However, this condition is usually diagnosed in adolescence or adulthood, not in young children.

+4 Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's cyanosis, rapid heartbeat, and heart enlargement are consistent with this diagnosis. However, this condition is usually associated with other conditions, such as lung disease or sleep apnea, which have not been mentioned.

+5 Heart Failure: The patient's cyanosis, rapid heartbeat, and heart enlargement are consistent with this diagnosis. However, this condition is usually caused by other conditions, such as coronary artery disease or high blood pressure, which are unlikely in a young child."
Non-syndromic anorectal malformation,"+1 Anorectal Malformation: The patient's symptoms of chronic constipation or fecal incontinence, discomfort during defecation, and physical examination findings of a poorly developed or absent anal opening, a fistula, and the presence of the anal opening in an unusual location are all consistent with this diagnosis. 

+2 VACTERL Association: This condition, which includes vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheo-esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities, could explain the patient's anorectal symptoms as well as the anomalies in the spine, sacrum, or lower limbs. 

+3 Hirschsprung's Disease: This condition, which involves a lack of nerve cells in the bowel, could cause chronic constipation or fecal incontinence and discomfort during defecation. However, it would not explain the urinary symptoms or physical examination findings. 

+4 Spina Bifida: This condition could explain the anomalies in the spine, sacrum, or lower limbs, and it can sometimes cause bowel and bladder problems. However, it would not typically cause the specific anorectal symptoms or physical examination findings seen in this patient. 

+5 Caudal Regression Syndrome: This rare disorder affects the development of the lower spine and can cause anomalies in the spine, sacrum, or lower limbs, as well as bowel and bladder problems. However, it would not typically cause the specific anorectal symptoms or physical examination findings seen in this patient."
Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,"+1: Psoriasis: The patient's well-demarcated, erythematous, itchy patches are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the lack of response to standard treatments is unusual. 

+2: Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis): The patient's symptoms of itchy, red patches that have progressively worsened over time could be consistent with this condition. However, the lack of response to standard treatments is atypical. 

+3: Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma: This condition could explain the patient's symptoms and the lack of response to standard treatments. However, the lack of significant lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly and normal complete blood cell count are not typical for this condition. 

+4: Lichen Planus: This condition can present with well-demarcated, itchy, red patches. However, it usually responds to standard treatments. 

+5: Contact Dermatitis: This condition could cause persistent, itchy red patches, especially if the patient is continually exposed to an allergen or irritant. However, the widespread nature of the rash and lack of response to standard treatments are not typical."
Autoimmune hepatitis,"+1 Autoimmune Hepatitis: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain, fever, and skin rashes, along with the presence of ANA and ASMA, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and abnormal liver function tests, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of other autoimmune diseases also supports this diagnosis.

+2 Primary Biliary Cholangitis: This condition could also present with fatigue, jaicundice, and abnormal liver function tests. However, the presence of ASMA is less common in PBC.

+3 Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis: Similar to PBC, PSC could present with similar symptoms and lab findings. However, the presence of ASMA and the patient's history of autoimmune diseases make AIH more likely.

+4 Viral Hepatitis: The patient's symptoms and abnormal liver function tests could be consistent with viral hepatitis. However, the presence of autoantibodies and a history of autoimmune diseases make this less likely.

+5 Liver Cirrhosis: The patient's hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and abnormal liver function tests could be indicative of cirrhosis. However, this is usually a late-stage manifestation of chronic liver disease and would typically present with more severe symptoms."
Multicystic dysplastic kidney,"+1: Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD): The patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort, a palpable mass, urinary tract infections, hematuria, hypertension, and poor growth, along with the findings of multiple non-communicating cysts in one kidney and compensatory hypertrophy in the other, are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of oligohydramnios in prenatal scans also supports this diagnosis. 

+2: Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD): The patient's symptoms and findings are also consistent with this diagnosis, although PKD typically presents later in life than ARPKD. 

+3: Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK): This condition could explain the patient's symptoms and findings, especially if this is a pediatric case. However, MCDK typically involves the complete non-function of one kidney, which may not be the case here.

+4: Renal Cell Carcinoma: While this diagnosis is less likely, especially in a pediatric case, the patient's symptoms of a palpable mass, hematuria, and hypertension could be consistent with this condition. 

+5: Simple Kidney Cysts: These could potentially cause the patient's symptoms and findings, although they are less likely to cause poor growth or failure to thrive."
Unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney,"+1 Unilateral Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK): The patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort, high blood pressure, recurrent urinary tract infections, and impaired renal function, along with the ultrasound findings of multiple non-communicating cysts in one kidney, are consistent with MCDK. However, the patient did not report any symptoms of urinary obstruction, which can occur in MCDK.

+2 Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD): The patient's history of oligohydramnios, failure to thrive, and growth retardation could suggest ARPKD. However, the ultrasound findings do not fully support this diagnosis, as ARPKD usually involves numerous small cysts in both kidneys.

+3 Hypothyroidism: The patient's failure to thrive and growth retardation could be due to hypothyroidism. However, this condition would not explain the kidney cysts.

+4 Growth Hormone Deficiency: The patient's failure to thrive and growth retardation could also suggest a growth hormone deficiency. Again, this condition would not explain the kidney cysts.

+5 Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient's abdominal lump, high blood pressure, and impaired renal function could suggest renal cell carcinoma. However, this condition typically presents with a single mass rather than multiple cysts, and the patient did not report any symptoms of hematuria, which is common in renal cell carcinoma."
Scarring in glaucoma filtration surgical procedures,"+1 Failed Glaucoma Surgery: The patient's symptoms of increased intraocular pressure, visual field defects, and reduced functioning of the surgical site are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient did not report any specific symptoms of glaucoma, such as seeing halos around lights or peripheral vision loss.

+2 Postoperative Endophthalmitis: The patient's symptoms of inflammation, possible fibrotic tissue development, and reduced functioning of the surgical site are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient did not report any specific symptoms of endophthalmitis, such as redness of the eye or discharge.

Pulmonary fungal infections in patients deemed at risk,"+1: Tuberculosis: The patient's symptoms of persistent cough, fever, fatigue, unexpected weight loss, and abnormal pulmonary findings are consistent with tuberculosis. The presence of swollen lymph nodes could also be indicative of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. However, the patient did not report night sweats, which are a common symptom of this condition.

+2: Lung Cancer: The persistent cough, unexpected weight loss, shortness of breath, and abnormal pulmonary findings could be indicative of lung cancer. The presence of skin lesions could suggest metastasis. However, the patient did not report chest pain, which is often associated with this condition.

+3: Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of persistent cough, fever, fatigue, and abnormal pulmonary findings could be indicative of pneumonia. The elevated inflammatory markers would also be consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient did not report chills or chest pain, which are common symptoms of this condition.

+4: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The persistent cough, shortness of breath, and abnormal pulmonary findings could be indicative of COPD. The lack of response to common treatments could suggest a chronic condition. However, the patient did not report a history of smoking, which is a major risk factor for this condition.

+5: Sarcoidosis: The patient's symptoms of persistent cough, shortness of breath, skin lesions, swollen lymph nodes, and abnormal pulmonary findings could be indicative of sarcoidosis. The elevated inflammatory markers would also be consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient did not report eye or skin symptoms, which are common in this condition."
Pouchitis,"+1 Pouchitis: The patient's symptoms of increased bowel frequency, urgency, nocturnal bowel movements, incontinence, abdominal pain, and systemic symptoms, along with their history of colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, are all consistent with pouchitis. The elevated inflammatory markers and possible bacterial overgrowth in stool cultures also support this diagnosis.

+2 Ulcerative Colitis Flare-Up: Although the patient has had a colectomy, it's possible that they could still have a flare-up of ulcerative colitis in the remaining part of the colon. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

+3 Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient's symptoms and the possible bacterial overgrowth in stool cultures could be due to a C. difficile infection, particularly if they have recently used antibiotics or been hospitalized.

+4 Irritable Bowel Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of increased bowel frequency, urgency, and abdominal pain could be due to IBS. However, this would not typically cause systemic symptoms or elevated inflammatory markers.

+5 Other Bacterial Infection: The patient's symptoms and the possible bacterial overgrowth in stool cultures could be due to another type of bacterial infection, such as Salmonella or E. coli. However, these would typically cause more acute symptoms and might also cause other symptoms, such as vomiting or bloody stools, which the patient did not report."
Congenital hypothyroidism due to developmental anomaly,"+1 Congenital Hypothyroidism: The patient's lack of energy, difficulty feeding, constipation, unusual sleepiness, larger-than-normal fontanel, thick and protruding tongue, distinctive cry, jaundice, skin mottling, slow growth, short length, puffy face, poor muscle tone, delayed developmental milestones, and abnormal thyroid function tests are all consistent with this diagnosis. 

+2 Down Syndrome: Some of the patient's symptoms, such as the thick and protruding tongue, distinctive cry, slow growth, short length, and poor muscle tone, could be seen in Down syndrome. However, the patient does not have other common features of Down syndrome, such as specific facial features or heart defects.

+3 Cretinism: This is a severe form of congenital hypothyroidism that can cause many of the patient's symptoms. However, it is less likely given the absence of severe intellectual disability and the presence of a larger-than-normal fontanel, which is not typically seen in cretinism.

+4 Prader-Willi Syndrome: This genetic disorder can cause poor muscle tone, slow growth, and feeding difficulties in infancy. However, the patient does not have other common features of Prader-Willi syndrome, such as a narrow forehead or almond-shaped eyes.

+5 Metabolic Disorders: Some metabolic disorders can cause symptoms such as lack of energy, difficulty feeding, and slow growth. However, these conditions would not typically cause the specific physical findings seen in this patient, such as the larger-than-normal fontanel or thick and protruding tongue."
Partial chromosome Y deletion,"+1 Klinefelter Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of infertility, underdeveloped genitals, decreased body hair, gynecomastia, and hormonal imbalances are consistent with Klinefelter syndrome. This condition is also associated with an extra X chromosome, which could be confirmed through genetic testing.

+2 Hypogonadism: The patient's low testosterone levels, increased FSH and LH levels, and symptoms of delayed puberty and infertility are indicative of hypogonadism. This condition can be caused by problems with the testes or the pituitary gland.

+3 Pituitary Tumor: A pituitary tumor could disrupt the production of FSH and LH, leading to the hormonal imbalances observed in the patient. This could also explain the gynecomastia. However, the patient did not report any other common symptoms of pituitary tumors, such as headaches or vision problems.

+4 Testicular Failure: The patient's infertility, low testosterone levels, and increased FSH and LH levels could be due to testicular failure. This condition refers to the inability of the testes to produce sperm or hormones. However, this diagnosis would not explain the patient's gynecomastia.

+5 Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH): Although less likely, CAH could potentially explain the patient's symptoms. This condition leads to an overproduction of adrenal hormones and can cause symptoms such as infertility and abnormal puberty. However, it is typically diagnosed in childhood and the patient did not report any other common symptoms, such as early puberty or rapid growth."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"+1 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: The patient's symptoms of persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in the morning or after periods of inactivity, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The joint pain and swelling, as well as the intermittent fever and rash, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient did not report any tick bites or a bull's-eye rash, which are common in Lyme disease.

+4 Kawasaki Disease: Although this is a rare condition, the patient's symptoms of joint pain, intermittent fever, and rash could be indicative of Kawasaki disease. However, the patient did not report any heart problems, which are a key symptom of this condition.

+5 Reactive Arthritis: This condition could cause the joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly if the patient has recently had an infection. However, the patient did not report any recent infections, which are typically associated with reactive arthritis."
Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"+1 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA): The patient's symptoms of persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in the knee joints, along with intermittent low-grade fevers and fatigue, are consistent with this diagnosis. The asymmetrical involvement of the joints, absence of systemic involvement, and duration of symptoms (six weeks or more) are also typical of JIA. However, the patient did not report any other symptoms such as eye inflammation, which can occur in some subtypes of JIA.

+2 Reactive Arthritis: This condition could also cause joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, particularly in the lower limbs. However, it is usually triggered by a preceding infection, which the patient did not report.

+3 Lyme Disease: Lyme disease can cause similar joint symptoms, along with intermittent fevers and fatigue. However, it is usually associated with a characteristic ""bull's eye"" rash and a history of tick bite, neither of which the patient reported.

+4 Psoriatic Arthritis: This is another possibility, given the joint symptoms. However, it is usually associated with skin symptoms such as psoriasis, which the patient did not report.

+5 Sarcoidosis: This condition can cause arthritis, along with fatigue and elevated inflammatory markers. However, it is usually associated with other systemic symptoms such as lung involvement or lymphadenopathy, which the patient did not report."
Non-syndromic posterior hypospadias,"+1 Hypospadias: The abnormal positioning of the urethral opening towards the base of the penis, the downward curvature of the penis (chordee), and the occasional difficulties with urinary stream are all consistent with this condition. There are no reported symptoms that contradict this diagnosis.

+2 Chordee without hypospadias: While less common, it is possible to have chordee without hypospadias. This would explain the downward curvature of the penis and some of the urinary symptoms, but not the abnormal positioning of the urethral opening.

+3 Urethral stricture: This condition could potentially cause the reported difficulties with urinary stream and discomfort during urination. However, it would not explain the abnormal positioning of the urethral opening or the downward curvature of the penis.

+4 Urethral diverticulum: This is a condition where a pouch forms in the urethra, which could potentially cause the reported urinary symptoms. However, it would not explain the abnormal positioning of the urethral opening or the downward curvature of the penis.

+5 Epispadias: This is a rare birth defect in males where the opening of the urethra is on the upper side of the penis. While this does not match the patient's reported symptoms, it is a differential diagnosis for abnormal urethral opening position. However, the patient's urethral opening is towards the base, not the upper side of the penis."
AIDS wasting syndrome,"+1 HIV/AIDS: The patient's severe weight loss, chronic diarrhea, fever, night sweats, and oral thrush are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's sexual history also increases the risk of HIV/AIDS. The patient does not report any other opportunistic infections, which are common in people with advanced HIV or AIDS.

+2 Tuberculosis: The patient's persistent fever, night sweats, and weight loss could be indicative of tuberculosis. However, the patient does not report a persistent cough, which is a common symptom of tuberculosis.

The patient's history of excessive alcohol consumption is a significant risk factor. 

+2 Cirrhosis: Although the patient does not have a history of chronic liver disease, their symptoms and history of excessive alcohol consumption could suggest cirrhosis. However, this is less likely than alcoholic hepatitis.

+3 Acute Cholecystitis: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and jaundice could be due to acute cholecystitis. However, this is less likely given the absence of gallstones.

+4 Liver Cancer: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings could suggest liver cancer. However, this is less likely given the absence of risk factors such as chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis.

+5 Hepatitis B or C: These viral infections can cause similar symptoms and liver damage. However, the patient's history does not suggest exposure to these viruses, making this less likely."
Sarcoidosis,"+1 Sarcoidosis: The patient's fatigue, weight loss, fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, joint pain, skin rashes, eye inflammation, and enlarged lymph nodes in the chest are all consistent with sarcoidosis. However, it's a relatively rare condition.

+2: Bronchiolitis: This condition could explain the difficulty breathing, fever, cough, and abnormal breath sounds. However, the patient did not report a runny nose or decreased appetite, which are also common symptoms of bronchiolitis.

+3: Asthma: The wheezing and difficulty breathing could be due to asthma. However, this condition is less common in infants and usually doesn't cause fever.

+4: Croup: This condition could cause difficulty breathing and a cough. However, the patient did not report a ""barking"" cough or stridor, which are characteristic of croup.

+5: Foreign body aspiration: This could cause sudden difficulty breathing and abnormal breath sounds. However, it usually doesn't cause fever, and the patient did not report choking or gagging, which often occur with foreign body aspiration."
Proximal spinal muscular atrophy,"+1 Muscular Dystrophy: The patient's progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, particularly in the proximal muscles, and difficulty with tasks requiring motor skills are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient did not report any family history of the disease, which is common in muscular dystrophy.
+2 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): The patient's muscle weakness, atrophy, and tongue fasciculations could be consistent with ALS. However, the patient did not report any difficulty speaking, which is a common symptom of ALS.

However, it is less likely given the patient's specific presentation and the rarity of the condition."
Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency,"+1 Sucrase-Isomaltase Deficiency: The patient's symptoms of chronic diarrhea, stomach cramping, bloating, and faltering weight gain, particularly after consuming sucrose-rich foods, are consistent with this condition. The presence of reducing substances in the stool is also a key symptom. The patient did not report any other symptoms that are inconsistent with this diagnosis.

+2 Fructose Malabsorption: This condition could also cause diarrhea and bloating after consuming fruits and sweets. However, it typically does not cause failure to thrive or weight loss, which the patient has experienced.

+3 Cystic Fibrosis: This genetic disorder could cause similar symptoms, but is less likely given the normal laboratory results and the specific trigger of sucrose-rich foods. The patient did not report any respiratory symptoms, which are common in cystic fibrosis.

+4 Congenital Sucrase-Isomaltase Deficiency (CSID): This is a more severe form of sucrase-isomaltase deficiency that presents in infancy. The patient's history of failure to thrive following the introduction of sucrose and starch into the diet could be consistent with this condition. However, CSID typically causes more severe symptoms than those reported by the patient.

+5 Other Disaccharidase Deficiencies: Other types of disaccharidase deficiencies could also cause similar symptoms. For example, lactase deficiency could cause diarrhea and bloating after consuming lactose-rich foods. However, the patient's symptoms are specifically triggered by sucrose-rich foods, which is not consistent with lactase deficiency."

+5 Congenital Heart Disease (unspecified): The patient's heart murmur, cyanosis, shortness of breath, and slow growth could be due to a variety of congenital heart diseases. Further testing would be needed to specify the exact type."
Brugada syndrome,"+1 Brugada Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of recurrent fainting, dizziness, palpitations, and shortness of breath, especially during rest or sleep, are consistent with this diagnosis. The ECG findings and family history of sudden cardiac arrest or sudden death in young individuals are also characteristic of Brugada Syndrome. 

+2 Long QT Syndrome: This condition could also cause the patient's symptoms and ECG findings. However, the patient did not report any episodes of sudden, unexplained death during sleep, which is a key symptom of Long QT Syndrome.

+3 Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT): This condition could cause the patient's symptoms and ECG findings. However, the patient did not report any episodes of syncope or cardiac arrest during physical activity or emotional stress, which are key symptoms of CPVT.

+2 Tethered Cord Syndrome: The patient's symptoms could also be due to this condition, particularly the lower extremity weakness, back pain, and bowel and bladder issues. However, the presence of a dimple or abnormal patch of hair on the lower back is more commonly associated with spina bifida.

+3 Cauda Equina Syndrome: While this condition could cause similar symptoms, it's less likely given that the symptoms have been present since birth and have gradually worsened over time. This condition typically presents acutely.

+4 Sacral Agenesis: This is a rare congenital disorder that could cause lower extremity weakness, bowel and bladder issues, and lower back pain. However, it's less likely given the presence of a dimple or abnormal patch of hair on the lower back, which is not typically associated with this condition.

+5 Neural Tube Defects (other than Spina Bifida): Other neural tube defects could potentially cause similar symptoms, but they are less likely given the specific combination of symptoms presented by the patient."
Isolated biliary atresia,"+1 Biliary Atresia: The infant's persistent jaundice, pale stools, dark urine, poor weight gain, irritability, hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal liver function tests, and ultrasound findings are all consistent with this condition. There are no key symptoms of biliary atresia that the patient did not report.

+2 Alagille Syndrome: This genetic disorder can cause liver disease, which could explain the infant's symptoms. However, other symptoms of Alagille syndrome, such as heart problems and distinctive facial features, were not reported.

+3 Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis: This genetic disorder causes progressive liver disease, which could explain the infant's symptoms. However, it typically presents with severe itching, which was not reported.

+4 Neonatal Hepatitis: This inflammation of the liver could explain the infant's symptoms. However, it is less likely than biliary atresia given the ultrasound findings of an abnormal biliary system.

+5 Choledochal Cyst: This congenital condition is characterized by cystic dilatation of the bile ducts, which could cause similar symptoms to those reported by the infant. However, it is less likely than biliary atresia given the infant's poor weight gain and irritability."
Anal fistula,"+1 Anal Fistula: The patient's symptoms of persistent anal discomfort, throbbing pain during bowel movements, intermittent anal discharge with blood or pus, recurrent anal abscesses, and the presence of one or more openings near the anus from which pus might be draining are all consistent with an anal fistula. However, the patient did not report any history of previous anal surgery or Crohn's disease, which are common causes of anal fistulas.

+2 Proctitis: The patient's symptoms of anal discomfort, pain during bowel movements, and anal discharge with blood or pus could be due to proctitis. However, proctitis does not typically cause abscesses or fistulas.

+3 Crohn's Disease: The patient's symptoms could be due to Crohn's disease, which can cause anal abscesses and fistulas, as well as anal discomfort and discharge. However, the patient did not report any other symptoms of Crohn's disease, such as abdominal pain or diarrhea.

+4 Anal Cancer: Although less likely, anal cancer could cause the patient's symptoms of anal discomfort, pain during bowel movements, and anal discharge. However, the patient's recurrent abscesses and possible fistula are not typical symptoms of anal cancer.

+5 Rectal Abscess: The patient's symptoms of anal discomfort, pain during bowel movements, anal discharge, and recurrent anal abscesses could be due to a rectal abscess. However, the presence of one or more openings near the anus from which pus might be draining suggests a possible fistula, which is not typically associated with a rectal abscess."
Adenovirus infection in immunocompromised patients,"+1: Influenza: The patient's symptoms of high fever, sore throat, persistent cough, malaise, and gastrointestinal symptoms are consistent with influenza. However, the conjunctivitis is not a typical symptom of influenza, and the initial negative tests for common respiratory infections may suggest another cause.

+2: COVID-19: The patient's symptoms, including high fever, persistent cough, difficulty breathing, and gastrointestinal symptoms, are consistent with COVID-19. The conjunctivitis and negative initial tests for common respiratory infections could be due to the variability in symptoms and testing accuracy for this disease.

+3: Legionnaires' disease: This bacterial infection can cause symptoms similar to those the patient is experiencing, including high fever, cough, difficulty breathing, gastrointestinal symptoms, and even conjunctivitis. The negative initial tests for common respiratory infections could be due to the fact that Legionnaires' disease is caused by a specific type of bacteria that may not be detected in standard tests.

+4: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection: This bacterial infection can cause respiratory symptoms similar to those the patient is experiencing, and it can also cause conjunctivitis. However, gastrointestinal symptoms are less common with this infection.

+5: Opportunistic infection: Given the patient's weakened immune system, they may be experiencing an opportunistic infection. This could include a variety of potential pathogens, and the wide range of symptoms could be due to the body's reduced ability to fight off the infection."
Non-infectious posterior uveitis,"+1 Posterior Uveitis: The patient's symptoms of recurring blurry vision, eye pain, floaters, and worsening of symptoms during evenings and nights, along with the physical findings of inflammation in the choroid and retina, vitreous haze, and retinal vasculitis, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of autoimmune disorders also supports this diagnosis.

+2 Retinal Detachment: While the patient's symptoms of blurry vision, floaters, and retinal vasculitis could suggest this condition, the absence of sudden vision loss makes it less likely.

+3 Glaucoma: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision and eye pain could be consistent with this condition, but the absence of peripheral vision loss and the presence of retinal vasculitis make it less likely.

+4 Optic Neuritis: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision and eye pain could suggest this condition, especially given the history of autoimmune disorders. However, the patient does not report pain with eye movement, which is a common symptom of optic neuritis.

+5 Sarcoidosis: This is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect the eyes and cause symptoms similar to those reported by the patient. However, the patient does not report any systemic symptoms, such as fatigue, fever, or weight loss, which are common in sarcoidosis."

+2 Paraneoplastic Pemphigus: This condition could cause the patient's oral ulcers and skin lesions, but it is less likely given the absence of other symptoms of cancer.
+3 Pemphigus Foliaceus: This condition could cause the patient's skin lesions and positive Nikolsky sign, but it is less likely because it usually does not involve the mucous membranes.
+4 Bullous Pemphigoid: This condition could cause the patient's skin lesions and positive Nikolsky sign, but it is less likely because it typically presents with tense blisters rather than the flaccid blisters described by the patient.
+5 Dermatitis Herpetiformis: This condition could cause the patient's skin lesions and positive Nikolsky sign, but it is less likely because it typically presents with tense blisters and is associated with gluten sensitivity, which the patient did not report."
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,"+1 Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of lethargy, difficulty feeding, rapid breathing, cyanosis, weak pulses, heart murmur, and enlarged liver are consistent with this condition. The echocardiogram findings of a small left ventricle and aorta also support this diagnosis. However, other symptoms of this condition, such as a rapid heartbeat or cold hands and feet, were not reported.

+2 Tetralogy of Fallot: This condition could explain the cyanosis and heart murmur, but it typically involves a large ventricular septal defect and an overriding aorta, which were not mentioned in the patient's description.

+3 Transposition of the Great Arteries: This condition could cause cyanosis and a heart murmur, but it typically involves the aorta and pulmonary artery being switched, which was not mentioned in the patient's description.

The possible hereditary component also supports this diagnosis. 

+2 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): While the patient's symptoms of muscle weakness and wasting, loss of sensation, and decreased deep tendon reflexes could be consistent with ALS, the lack of reported difficulty with speaking, swallowing, or breathing makes this less likely.

+3 Muscular dystrophy: The patient's symptoms of progressive muscle weakness and wasting could be consistent with a form of muscular dystrophy. However, the lack of reported heart problems makes this less likely.

+4 Peripheral neuropathy: The patient's symptoms of loss of sensation in the feet and hands, described as constant numbness or tingling, along with muscle weakness and decreased deep tendon reflexes, are consistent with peripheral neuropathy. However, this is a broad diagnosis and further testing would be needed to determine the specific type and cause.

+5 Spinal muscular atrophy: This condition could cause the muscle weakness and wasting, decreased deep tendon reflexes, and difficulty with fine motor skills that the patient is experiencing. However, this condition typically presents in infancy or childhood, making it less likely given that this is a new patient at a primary care clinic."
Familial isolated dilated cardiomyopathy,"+1: Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, weight gain, and swelling in the lower extremities, along with the physical findings of an S3 gallop, jugular venous distension, and peripheral edema, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient did not report any chest pain, which can sometimes occur in heart failure.

+2: Hereditary Cardiomyopathy: Given the patient's family history of heart failure and sudden cardiac death at young ages, a genetic form of cardiomyopathy could be a possibility. The symptoms and physical findings are consistent with this diagnosis. However, genetic testing would be needed to confirm.

+3: Chronic Kidney Disease: This condition can cause fluid overload and swelling, which could explain the patient's weight gain and edema. However, it does not typically cause an S3 gallop or jugular venous distension.

+4: Hypothyroidism: This condition can cause fatigue, weight gain, and heart palpitations. However, it does not typically cause an S3 gallop, jugular venous distension, or peripheral edema.

+5: Pulmonary Hypertension or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): These conditions could cause shortness of breath and fatigue. However, they do not typically cause an S3 gallop, jugular venous distension, or peripheral edema, and would not explain the patient's weight gain."
Gastroschisis,"+1 Gastroschisis: The visible opening on the right side of the umbilical cord with protruding, inflamed, and possibly twisted intestines is a key symptom of this condition. The baby's feeding difficulties, failure to gain weight, signs of distress, and complications such as respiratory problems, infection, and dehydration are also consistent with this diagnosis. 

+2 Omphalocele: Although less likely due to the absence of a protective sac covering the protruding intestines, this condition could potentially cause similar symptoms. 

+3 Intestinal atresia: This condition, which involves a blockage of the intestine, could potentially cause symptoms such as feeding difficulties, failure to gain weight, and signs of distress. However, it would not typically cause the intestines to protrude through an opening in the belly.

+4 Necrotizing enterocolitis: This serious condition, which involves inflammation and infection of the intestine, could potentially cause symptoms such as feeding difficulties, failure to gain weight, and signs of distress. However, it is more common in premature babies and would not typically cause the intestines to protrude through an opening in the belly.

+5 Intrauterine growth restriction: This condition could explain the baby's smaller size for gestational age and possible growth problems. However, it would not typically cause the intestines to protrude through an opening in the belly."
Trisomy 18,"+1 Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome): The severe growth deficiency, distinct facial features (small jaw, low-set ears, severe upward slant of the eyes), hand anomalies (clenched fists with overlapping fingers), intellectual disability, potential congenital heart defects, and frequent respiratory infections are all consistent with this diagnosis. 

+2 Cornelia de Lange syndrome: The slow growth, intellectual disability, and distinct facial features could be indicative of this condition. However, the hand anomalies are more characteristic of Trisomy 18.

+3 Turner syndrome: The growth deficiency and potential heart defects could suggest this condition. However, the patient does not exhibit lymphedema or a broad chest, which are common in Turner syndrome.

+4 Prader-Willi syndrome: This condition includes growth deficiency and intellectual disability, but the patient does not exhibit excessive hunger or obesity, which are typical of Prader-Willi syndrome.

+5 Cri-du-chat syndrome: The intellectual disability and potential heart defects could suggest this condition. However, the patient does not exhibit a high-pitched, cat-like cry, which is characteristic of Cri-du-chat syndrome."
Recessive X-linked ichthyosis,"+1 X-linked Ichthyosis: The patient's chronic, widespread dry skin that appears rough and scaly, often described as ""fish-like"", the presence of large, dark scales particularly on the extensor surfaces such as the elbows and knees, with sparing of the face, hands, and feet, corneal opacities, undescended testes, and a family history of female carriers are all consistent with this diagnosis. 

+2 Ichthyosis Vulgaris: This is the most common form of ichthyosis and could potentially cause similar symptoms, although the sparing of the face, hands, and feet is less typical. 

+3 Psoriasis: This skin condition can cause dry, scaly skin, particularly on the extensor surfaces, but it typically also affects the scalp, which the patient did not report. 

+4 Atopic Dermatitis: This is a common cause of dry, scaly skin, but it typically starts in infancy and is often associated with other allergic conditions, which the patient did not report. 

+5 Lamellar Ichthyosis: This is a rare form of ichthyosis that could potentially cause similar symptoms, but it typically presents with a collodion membrane at birth, which the patient did not report."
Acute peripheral arterial occlusion,"+1 Acute Limb Ischemia: The patient's severe, sudden pain, coldness, color changes, and decreased or absent pulse in the limb are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient did not report any symptoms inconsistent with acute limb ischemia.

+2 Peripheral Artery Disease: The patient's symptoms could be consistent with a severe or advanced case of PAD, especially given their risk factors for vascular disease. However, PAD typically develops gradually rather than suddenly.

+3 Aortic Dissection: If the dissection extends to the arteries supplying the limb, it could cause similar symptoms. However, the patient did not report severe chest or back pain, which is a key symptom of aortic dissection.

+4 Compartment Syndrome: This condition could cause severe pain and sensory changes in the limb. However, it is usually associated with a history of trauma, which the patient did not report.

+5 Deep Vein Thrombosis: DVT could cause pain and color changes in the limb. However, it would typically also cause swelling, which the patient did not report."
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia,"+1 Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT): The patient's recurrent nosebleeds, telangiectasias, blood in the stool, and family history are all consistent with this diagnosis. HHT can also cause gastrointestinal bleeding and stroke, which have occurred in the patient's family. 

+2 Von Willebrand Disease (VWD): This bleeding disorder could explain the patient's recurrent nosebleeds and blood in the stool. However, it typically does not cause telangiectasias, which the patient has.

+3 Liver Disease (e.g., Cirrhosis): Liver disease can cause telangiectasias, fatigue, and blood in the stool. However, the patient's family history and the absence of other typical symptoms of liver disease make this less likely.

+4 Anemia: The patient's fatigue and mild anemia could be related, and severe anemia can sometimes cause nosebleeds. However, anemia would not explain the telangiectasias or the family history.

+5 Other Genetic Disorders: There are other, less common genetic disorders that can cause similar symptoms to those the patient is experiencing. Genetic testing could help identify these."
Primary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,"+1 Glomerulonephritis: The patient's symptoms of proteinuria, hematuria, high blood pressure, and edema are consistent with this condition. However, the patient did not report any recent infections or use of medications that could cause glomerulonephritis.

The patient's symptoms of frequent cavities, chipped and broken teeth, and dental sensitivity are consistent with this diagnosis. However, this condition is typically associated with a family history of similar dental issues, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

+2 Dentinogenesis Imperfecta: This genetic disorder affects the development of dentin, leading to discolored teeth, increased sensitivity, and structural issues. The patient's symptoms of discolored teeth, dental sensitivity, and enamel that separates easily from the dentin are consistent with this diagnosis. However, this condition is also typically associated with a family history of similar dental issues.

+3 Dentin Dysplasia: This condition affects the development of the dentin, leading to structural issues and increased risk of damage. The patient's symptoms of frequent cavities, chipped and broken teeth, and dental sensitivity are consistent with this diagnosis. However, this condition is also typically associated with a family history of similar dental issues.

+4 Fluorosis: This condition is caused by excessive fluoride exposure and can lead to discolored, translucent, or opalescent teeth, as well as structural issues. The patient's symptoms of discolored teeth and dental sensitivity are consistent with this diagnosis. However, this condition is typically associated with specific exposures, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

+5 Tetracycline Staining: This condition is caused by exposure to tetracycline during tooth development and can lead to discolored teeth and structural issues.

Thyroid ectopia,"+1 Ectopic Thyroid: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance, along with the laboratory findings of elevated TSH and low T4 levels, are consistent with hypothyroidism. The absence of the thyroid gland in its normal location and the presence of thyroid tissue in an abnormal location are indicative of ectopic thyroid. The patient's difficulties in swallowing or breathing could be due to the ectopic thyroid tissue obstructing the airway or esophagus.

+2 Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: This condition can cause hypothyroidism, which would explain the patient's symptoms and lab findings. However, it would not typically result in ectopic thyroid tissue, and the thyroid gland may be atrophic rather than absent.

+3 Thyroid Cancer: This could potentially cause hypothyroidism and difficulty swallowing or breathing if the tumor is large enough to compress the esophagus or airway. However, this would not explain the absence of the thyroid gland in its normal location or the presence of ectopic thyroid tissue.

+4 Thyroiditis (non-Hashimoto's): Other forms of thyroiditis could potentially cause hypothyroidism and an atrophic or non-palpable thyroid gland. However, they would not typically result in ectopic thyroid tissue.

+5 Iodine Deficiency: This could potentially cause hypothyroidism, but it would not explain the absence of the thyroid gland in its normal location or the presence of ectopic thyroid tissue. It is also less likely given that iodine deficiency is rare in developed countries."

+2 Other Interstitial Lung Diseases: Other ILDs could also cause these symptoms. The specific type of ILD would depend on the results of further tests, such as HRCT and lung biopsy.

+3 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: While the patient's symptoms could be consistent with COPD, the lack of a smoking history makes this diagnosis less likely. 

+4 Lung Cancer: The patient's symptoms could be consistent with lung cancer, but the presence of clubbing and fine crackles on auscultation is more indicative of ILDs. 

+5 Heart Failure: While heart failure could cause shortness of breath and fatigue, the presence of clubbing and fine crackles on auscultation is less common in heart failure."
Systemic mastocytosis,"+1 Systemic Mastocytosis: The patient's symptoms of flushing, rashes, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, headaches, lightheadedness, palpitations, irritability, anaphylaxis, dermatographism, and elevated tryptase levels are all consistent with this diagnosis. The history of bone pain and fractures could also be explained by this condition. 

+2 Carcinoid Syndrome: This condition could explain the flushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and palpitations. However, it would not typically cause rashes, dermatographism, or elevated tryptase levels.

+3 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): This autoimmune condition could explain the rashes, fatigue, headaches, and possibly the bone pain and fractures. However, it would not typically cause flushing, diarrhea, or elevated tryptase levels.

+4 Allergic Reaction/Anaphylaxis: The patient's symptoms could be due to a severe allergic reaction. However, this would not typically cause bone pain or fractures, and it would not explain the elevated tryptase levels.

+5 Pheochromocytoma: This rare tumor of the adrenal gland could cause flushing, headaches, palpitations, and lightheadedness. However, it would not typically cause rashes, diarrhea, or bone pain and fractures."
Hemophilia A,"+1 Hemophilia A: This condition is characterized by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII. The patient's symptoms of prolonged bleeding, spontaneous bleeding into joints and muscles, and a prolonged aPTT are consistent with this diagnosis. Hemophilia A is typically inherited, so a family history of the disease would further support this diagnosis.

+2 Hemophilia B: This condition is similar to Hemophilia A but is caused by a deficiency in clotting factor IX. The patient's symptoms and lab results are also consistent with this diagnosis. Like Hemophilia A, Hemophilia B is typically inherited.

+3 Von Willebrand disease: This condition involves a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, which is necessary for clot formation. The patient's symptoms of prolonged bleeding and spontaneous bleeding into joints and muscles could be explained by this condition. However, the patient's normal bleeding time and possible normal aPTT would be less consistent with this diagnosis.

+4 Rare clotting factor deficiencies (other than VIII and IX): These conditions could potentially explain the patient's symptoms and lab results. However, they are less likely than Hemophilia A or B given their rarity.

+5 Acquired coagulation disorders (e.g., liver disease, vitamin K deficiency): These conditions could potentially cause the patient's symptoms and lab results. However, they are less likely given the patient's young age and the absence of other symptoms such as jaundice or malnutrition."
Neuroblastoma,"+1 Neuroblastoma: This is a type of cancer that often starts in the adrenal glands, which could explain the high blood pressure. It can also cause abdominal pain and a palpable mass, changes in bowel habits, and systemic symptoms like fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Neuroblastoma can also cause neurological symptoms if it spreads to the nerves or brain, which could explain the limping, drooping eyelids, unequal pupil sizes, and vision changes. 

+2 Wilms' tumor: This is a type of kidney cancer that is most common in children. It can cause abdominal pain and a palpable mass, changes in bowel habits, and systemic symptoms like fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss. However, it does not typically cause neurological symptoms or high blood pressure.

+3 Pheochromocytoma: This is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that can cause high blood pressure, as well as systemic symptoms like fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss. However, it does not typically cause abdominal pain or a palpable mass, changes in bowel habits, or neurological symptoms.

Some brain tumors can also cause systemic symptoms like fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss. However, they do not typically cause abdominal pain or a palpable mass, changes in bowel habits, or high blood pressure.

+5 Horner's syndrome: This is a condition that can cause drooping eyelids, unequal pupil sizes, and vision changes. It can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions, including tumors, inflammation, or nerve damage. However, it does not typically cause abdominal pain or a palpable mass, changes in bowel habits, systemic symptoms, or high blood pressure."
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"+1 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL): The patient's symptoms of fatigue, infections, weight loss, bleeding, petechiae, bone pain, and abnormal blood counts are all consistent with ALL. The high proportion of immature white blood cells is particularly suggestive of this diagnosis.

+3 Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML): While the patient's symptoms could also be consistent with CML, the high proportion of immature white blood cells is more characteristic of acute leukemias. However, CML cannot be ruled out without further testing.

+4 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: The patient's lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and systemic symptoms could be consistent with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. However, the high proportion of immature white blood cells is less typical of this condition.

+5 Myelodysplastic Syndromes: These are a group of disorders caused by poorly formed blood cells or cells that do not work properly, which could potentially explain the patient's symptoms. However, the high proportion of immature white blood cells and the systemic nature of the symptoms make this less likely than the above diagnoses."
Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome,"+1 Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome: The patient's primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, cyclic abdominal pain, shallow or absent vagina, and potential underdeveloped or absent uterus and cervix are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient did not report any kidney anomalies, which can occur in some cases of MRKH syndrome.

+2 Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS): The patient's primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and shallow or absent vagina could be consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient has normal ovaries, which is not typical of AIS, and she did not report any testes, which would be expected in AIS.

+3 Swyer Syndrome: The patient's primary amenorrhea and normal secondary sexual characteristics could be consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient has normal ovaries, which is not typical of Swyer Syndrome, and she did not report any streak gonads, which would be expected in this condition.

Williams syndrome,"+1 Williams Syndrome: The patient's distinct craniofacial features, developmental delays, strong verbal abilities, friendly personality, heart murmurs, high calcium levels, and sensitivity to noise are all consistent with this diagnosis. However, the slow weight gain is not a typical feature of this syndrome.

+2 Prader-Willi Syndrome: The developmental delays and feeding difficulties in early life could be consistent with this syndrome, but the lack of excessive hunger and obesity in later childhood makes this less likely.

+3 Noonan Syndrome: The distinctive facial features and heart problems could be consistent with this syndrome, but the lack of short stature and other physical features makes this less likely.

+4 DiGeorge Syndrome: This syndrome can cause heart defects, distinctive facial features, and developmental delays, but it is typically associated with immune system problems and low calcium levels, which does not fit with this patient's presentation.

+5 Smith-Magenis Syndrome: This syndrome can cause distinctive facial features, developmental delays, and behavioral problems, but it is typically associated with sleep disturbances and other physical features that are not mentioned in this case."
Alopecia totalis,"+1 Alopecia Universalis: This condition is characterized by complete loss of hair on the scalp and body, which matches the patient's symptoms. However, it is a rare condition and usually has a genetic component, which the patient does not report. 

+2 Alopecia Areata: This autoimmune disorder can cause patchy hair loss that can progress to more extensive or even total hair loss. The patient's symptoms of progressive hair loss could be consistent with this condition. 

+3 Androgenetic Alopecia: This form of hair loss usually follows a specific pattern and does not typically result in complete body hair loss. However, it could potentially explain the patient's symptoms if it is a severe case. 

+4 Telogen Effluvium: This condition causes temporary hair shedding, often after a significant stressor. The patient does not report any such stressor, but the condition could still be a possibility. 

+5 Anagen Effluvium: This condition causes hair loss during the growth phase and is most commonly caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The patient has not undergone such treatments, but the condition could still potentially explain the symptoms."

+3 Pheochromocytoma: This rare tumor could cause the flushing, rapid heartbeat, and lightheadedness. However, it is less likely given the presence of urticaria pigmentosa and elevated tryptase levels.

+4 Lymphoma: The enlarged liver, spleen, or lymph nodes could be indicative of a lymphoma. However, this condition would not typically cause the other symptoms the patient is experiencing.

+5 Hepatitis: The enlarged liver and nausea could be symptoms of hepatitis. However, this condition would not typically cause the other symptoms the patient is experiencing, and it does not explain the elevated tryptase levels."
Partial deep dermal and full thickness burns,"+1 Severe Burns: The patient's symptoms of severe pain, skin discoloration, blistering, leathery or waxy skin, swelling, and areas of painlessness despite severe visual damage are all consistent with severe burns, possibly including third-degree burns. The systemic symptoms could be due to shock or severe dehydration caused by the burns. 

+2 Frostbite: The symptoms of skin discoloration, blistering, leathery or waxy skin, and unusual coldness could also be consistent with severe frostbite. However, this would not explain the patient's systemic symptoms unless they were also exposed to extreme cold for a prolonged period.

+3 Necrotizing Fasciitis: This severe skin infection can cause symptoms similar to those of severe burns, including severe pain, skin discoloration, swelling, and systemic symptoms. However, it would not typically cause areas of painlessness.

+4 Severe Allergic Reaction: A severe allergic reaction could potentially cause skin symptoms similar to those of burns, as well as systemic symptoms. However, it would not typically cause areas of painlessness or the specific types of skin discoloration and damage seen in this patient.

+5 Autoimmune Skin Condition: Certain severe autoimmune conditions, such as pemphigus vulgaris, could potentially cause blistering and other skin symptoms similar to those of burns. However, they would not typically cause the severe pain, localized coldness, or systemic symptoms seen in this patient."
Acquired aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage,"+1 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: The sudden and severe headache, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, loss of consciousness, seizures, and signs of meningeal irritation are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient did not report a history of hypertension or smoking, which are risk factors for this condition.

+3 Meningitis: The stiff neck, sensitivity to light, confusion, and signs of meningeal irritation could suggest meningitis. However, this condition usually presents with fever, which the patient did not report.
+4 Brain Tumor: The focal neurological deficits, signs of increased intracranial pressure, and seizures could be due to a brain tumor. However, these symptoms usually develop more gradually than reported by the patient.
+5 Brain Abscess: Similar to a brain tumor, a brain abscess could cause focal neurological deficits, signs of increased intracranial pressure, and seizures. However, this condition usually presents with fever and a history of a source of infection, which the patient did not report."
Rett syndrome,"+1: Rett Syndrome: The patient's symptoms, including the regression in motor and language skills, repetitive hand movements, slowed growth, and possible breathing irregularities, are all consistent with Rett Syndrome. This condition typically develops after 6-18 months of normal development, which matches the patient's history. However, Rett Syndrome is usually associated with specific genetic mutations, which were not identified in the standard genetic screening. More specific genetic testing for the MECP2 gene, which is commonly mutated in Rett Syndrome, may be needed.

+2: Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD): This condition is characterized by a marked regression in multiple areas of functioning after a period of normal development, which matches the patient's symptoms. However, CDD is usually associated with more severe social impairment and loss of bowel and bladder control, which the patient does not appear to have.

+3: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): While the patient's social impairment and repetitive behaviors could suggest ASD, the significant regression in skills and slowed physical growth are not typical for this condition. ASD is usually associated with a delay in development rather than a regression.

+4: Late-Onset Tay-Sachs Disease: This condition can cause a regression in motor and language skills, as well as seizures. However, it is usually associated with a decrease in muscle tone, which the patient does not have. Additionally, Tay-Sachs Disease is a metabolic disorder, which should have been identified in the metabolic screening.

+5: Angelman Syndrome: This condition can cause developmental delay, movement or balance disorder, and abnormal behaviors. However, it is usually associated with a happy demeanor and frequent laughter, which the patient does not appear to have. Additionally, Angelman Syndrome is a genetic disorder, which should have been identified in the genetic screening."
Phenylketonuria,"+1 Phenylketonuria (PKU): The patient's symptoms of a musty or mousy odor in the breath and urine, elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood, decreased tyrosine levels, microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures, fair skin and hair, and failure to thrive are all consistent with PKU. The patient did not report any dietary restrictions, which are common in PKU to manage phenylalanine levels.

+2 Tyrosinemia: This condition also involves a defect in amino acid metabolism and can cause developmental delay, failure to thrive, and seizures. However, it is less likely due to the absence of liver and kidney problems, which are common in Tyrosinemia.

+3 Maple Syrup Urine Disease: This metabolic disorder can cause developmental delay, seizures, and failure to thrive. However, the patient's urine does not have the characteristic sweet, maple syrup-like odor associated with this condition.

+4 Hypothyroidism: This condition can cause developmental delay and failure to thrive. However, the patient does not have other common symptoms such as constipation, dry skin, and cold intolerance.

Familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine,"+1 Hemiplegic Migraine: The patient's symptoms of recurrent, severe, unilateral throbbing headaches, often preceded by temporary neurological symptoms such as visual disturbances, motor weakness, sensory disturbances, and difficulty with coordination and balance, are highly suggestive of this diagnosis. The fact that these symptoms resolve completely between episodes and that there is a family history of similar symptoms further supports this diagnosis.

+2 Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): The patient's temporary neurological symptoms could potentially be caused by TIAs, but these are typically not associated with headaches.

+3 Seizure Disorder (Epilepsy): The patient's temporary neurological symptoms could potentially be caused by a seizure disorder, but these would typically not be associated with the severe, throbbing headaches described by the patient.

+4 Multiple Sclerosis: The patient's symptoms could potentially be caused by multiple sclerosis, but these would typically not resolve completely between episodes.

+5 Brain Tumor: The patient's symptoms could potentially be caused by a brain tumor, but these would typically not resolve completely between episodes and would likely be associated with other symptoms not reported by the patient."
Acute myeloid leukemia,"+1: Acute Leukemia: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weakness, breathlessness, recurrent infections, spontaneous bruising, bleeding gums, fever, night sweats, pallor, and petechiae, along with the lab findings of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and high white blood cell count, are all consistent with acute leukemia. The patient did not report any specific symptoms of organ infiltration, such as bone pain or hepatosplenomegaly, which can sometimes occur in leukemia.

+4: Aplastic Anemia: This condition could also explain the patient's anemia, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections. However, like myelodysplastic syndrome, it would not typically present with a high white blood cell count.

+5: Myeloproliferative Neoplasm: This is a group of diseases that result in overproduction of blood cells. However, these conditions would typically present with an overproduction of one type of blood cell, rather than the pancytopenia seen in this patient."
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome,"+1 Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS): This is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the brain, immune system, and skin. The patient's symptoms, including severe irritability, regression in developmental milestones, abnormal muscle tone, and involuntary movements, are consistent with AGS. The white appearance in the back of the eye could be due to chorioretinal scarring, a common feature of AGS. The elevated levels of interferon-alpha and interferon-stimulated genes in the blood, as well as the white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, are also indicative of AGS. However, the patient did not report any skin abnormalities, which are often seen in AGS.

+2 Rett syndrome: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects brain development, resulting in severe mental and physical disability. The patient's symptoms, including regression in developmental milestones, abnormal posturing, and irritability, are consistent with Rett syndrome. However, this condition is usually seen in girls, and the patient did not report any repetitive hand movements, a key symptom of Rett syndrome.

+3 Krabbe disease: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. The patient's symptoms, including irritability, decreased feeding, abnormal posturing, and regression in developmental milestones, are consistent with Krabbe disease.

However, the patient did not report any macrocephaly (an abnormally large head), which is often seen in Canavan disease."
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,"+1 Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH): The patient's elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens, decreased cortisol, signs of virilization, and history of electrolyte imbalances are all consistent with CAH. The patient did not report any salt-wasting crises, which are often seen in severe forms of this condition.

+2 Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's low cortisol levels, severe fatigue, and low blood pressure could be due to adrenal insufficiency. However, this condition does not typically cause virilization or electrolyte imbalances.

+3 Cushing's Syndrome: This condition is characterized by excessive cortisol production, which is inconsistent with the patient's low cortisol levels. However, it can cause hirsutism and irregular menstruation.

+4 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): This condition can cause hirsutism, irregular menstruation, and androgen excess. However, it does not typically cause electrolyte imbalances or low cortisol levels.

+5 Androgen-secreting tumor: An androgen-secreting tumor could cause the patient's signs of virilization and androgen excess. However, these tumors are rare and do not typically cause electrolyte imbalances or low cortisol levels."
Dysbetalipoproteinemia,"+1: Familial Hypercholesterolemia: This condition is characterized by high cholesterol levels, which can lead to early-onset heart disease. The patient's elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, corneal arcus, and family history of heart disease are consistent with this diagnosis.

Septo-optic dysplasia spectrum,"+1 Septo-optic dysplasia: This condition is consistent with the patient's visual problems, pituitary hormone deficiencies, neurological symptoms, and potential underdevelopment or absence of the septum pellucidum and/or optic nerves. The history of complications during pregnancy or substance use during pregnancy could also be relevant, as these factors can increase the risk of septo-optic dysplasia.

+2 Congenital hypopituitarism: This condition could explain the patient's pituitary hormone deficiencies and some of the neurological symptoms, but it would not typically cause the visual problems or underdevelopment or absence of the septum pellucidum.

+3 Optic nerve hypoplasia: This condition could cause the patient's visual problems and could be associated with pituitary hormone deficiencies if it is part of a broader syndrome, such as septo-optic dysplasia. However, it would not typically cause the other neurological symptoms.

+4 Holoprosencephaly: This is a severe brain malformation that can cause a range of symptoms, including visual problems, pituitary hormone deficiencies, and neurological symptoms. However, it would typically cause more severe symptoms than those reported by the patient.

+5 Congenital infection (such as congenital rubella or toxoplasmosis): These conditions can cause a range of symptoms, including visual problems, growth and developmental issues, and neurological symptoms. However, they would not typically cause the specific findings on MRI seen in this patient."
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans,"+1 Kaposi's Sarcoma: The slow-growing, firm, painless nodule that may be pink, red, or purple aligns with this diagnosis. However, Kaposi's sarcoma is often associated with immunosuppression, such as in HIV/AIDS patients, which we don't have information about in this case.

+5 Dermatofibroma: The firm, painless nodule aligns with this diagnosis. However, dermatofibromas are usually brownish and occur more often on the legs than the trunk."
Duane retraction syndrome,"+1 Duane Syndrome: The patient's inability to move the eyes outward or inward, globe retraction, and the upshoot or downshoot phenomenon are all characteristic symptoms of Duane syndrome. However, this condition is usually present from birth, so the patient's age and the onset of symptoms would be important factors to consider.

+2 Abducens Nerve Palsy: The patient's inability to move the eyes outward could be due to a problem with the abducens nerve, which controls the lateral rectus muscle responsible for this movement. Strabismus and double vision are also common symptoms of this condition.

+3 Oculomotor Nerve Palsy: The patient's ptosis and possibly the inability to move the eyes inward (if it affects the medial rectus muscle) could suggest a problem with the oculomotor nerve. However, this condition often also causes other symptoms such as pupil dilation and eye pain, which the patient did not report.

+4 Myasthenia Gravis: This is a neuromuscular disorder that can cause ptosis and strabismus. However, it typically also causes muscle weakness in other parts of the body, which the patient did not report.

+5: G6PD Deficiency: This condition could cause the patient's fatigue, shortness of breath, anemia, jaundice, and atypically shaped red blood cells. The patient did not report any episodes of hemolytic crisis triggered by certain medications, foods, or infections, which are common in this condition."
Polymalformative genetic syndrome with increased risk of developing cancer,"+1 Noonan Syndrome: This condition is consistent with the patient's asymmetrical limbs, congenital heart defects, and predisposition to malignancies. However, it doesn't typically cause recurrent infections. 
+2 Costello Syndrome: This condition could explain the patient's asymmetrical limbs, congenital heart defects, skin pigmentation abnormalities, and predisposition to malignancies. However, it doesn't typically cause recurrent infections. 
+3 Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): This condition could explain the patient's skin pigmentation abnormalities and predisposition to malignancies, but it doesn't typically cause the other anomalies mentioned. 
+4 Turner Syndrome: This condition could explain the patient's asymmetrical limbs and congenital heart defects, but it doesn't typically cause the skin pigmentation abnormalities or predisposition to malignancies. 
+5 Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID): This condition could explain the patient's recurrent infections and predisposition to malignancies, but it doesn't typically cause the other anomalies mentioned."
Aplasia cutis congenita,"+1 Adams-Oliver syndrome: This condition is characterized by scalp defects, limb abnormalities, and often cardiovascular anomalies, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. However, the patient did not report any specific limb malformations, which are common in this condition.

+2 Cutis aplasia: This condition is characterized by a localized absence of skin at birth, which could explain the scalp defects. However, this condition typically does not involve the wide range of additional anomalies reported by the patient.

+3 Aplasia cutis congenita: This condition involves congenital absence of skin, which could explain the scalp defects. However, it typically does not involve the wide range of additional anomalies reported by the patient.

+4 Ectodermal dysplasia: This group of disorders is characterized by abnormal development of ectodermal tissues, which could explain the scalp and nail abnormalities. However, it typically involves additional symptoms such as abnormal teeth and sweat glands, which the patient did not report.

+5 Pfeiffer syndrome: This condition involves abnormal development of the skull, which could explain the skull bone abnormalities. However, it typically involves additional symptoms such as broad, short thumbs and toes, which the patient did not report."
Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"+1 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD): The patient's symptoms of difficulty in walking, falling, unusual gait, muscle weakness, particularly in the lower limbs, muscle wasting, calf pseudohypertrophy, and a positive Gower's sign are all consistent with DMD. The late achievement of milestones and learning and behavioral difficulties are also seen in DMD. 

+2 Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD): The patient's symptoms could also be consistent with BMD, which is similar to DMD but usually has a later onset and slower progression. 

+3 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA): The patient's muscle weakness and wasting could be indicative of SMA. However, the presence of calf pseudohypertrophy is not typical in SMA.

+4 Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD): The patient's symptoms could be consistent with LGMD, but the onset is usually in late childhood or early adulthood, and the progression is slower.

+5 Congenital Myopathy: The patient's symptoms could be consistent with a congenital myopathy, but these disorders usually present with more generalized muscle weakness."
Dravet syndrome,"+1 Dravet Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of prolonged or recurrent seizures starting in the first year of life, developmental regression, ataxia, unsteady gait, hyperactivity, sleep disturbances, orthopedic issues, and dysautonomia are all consistent with Dravet syndrome. The resistance to standard seizure medications and the SCN1A gene mutation are also characteristic of this condition.

+2 Genetic Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus (GEFS+): This condition is associated with the SCN1A gene mutation and can present with recurrent seizures triggered by fever, although it is typically milder than Dravet syndrome. The patient's developmental issues and other symptoms could potentially be explained by this diagnosis, although they are more commonly associated with Dravet syndrome.

+3 Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome: This is a severe form of epilepsy that can present with different types of seizures, developmental delay, and resistance to seizure medications. However, it typically does not involve the SCN1A gene mutation and usually begins later in childhood.

+4 Other SCN1A-related epilepsies: There are other, less common types of epilepsy associated with the SCN1A gene mutation that could potentially explain the patient's symptoms.

+5 Other neurodevelopmental disorders: While the patient's symptoms strongly suggest a form of epilepsy, it's also possible that they could be due to another neurodevelopmental disorder, particularly if the seizures are not the primary symptom. Further testing would be needed to confirm this."
