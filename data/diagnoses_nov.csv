GT,Diagnosis 1
Síndrome de Down,"+1. Down Syndrome: This is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual disability. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8 or 9-year-old child, but this varies widely. The symptoms that match with the patient's condition include distinct facial features such as a flat facial profile, upward slanting eyes with a characteristic fold of skin (epicanthic fold), small ears, and a protruding tongue. The cognitive delays, with an average IQ range of 50-70, hypotonia or low muscle tone, short stature, sociability, and affinity for routine-based tasks are also common in Down Syndrome. The presence of health complications like heart defects and gastrointestinal abnormalities in some individuals also aligns with the symptoms of Down Syndrome.

+2. Turner Syndrome: This is a chromosomal condition that alters development in females. Women with this condition tend to be shorter than average and are usually unable to conceive a child (infertile) because of an absence of ovarian function. Other features of this condition that could potentially match with the patient's symptoms include a low hairline at the back of the neck, puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the hands and feet, skeletal abnormalities, and kidney problems. However, the patient does not exhibit these symptoms, making this diagnosis less likely.

It is most common in children aged 5 or younger. Symptoms that match include the abnormal growth of cells near the adrenal glands, rapid and aggressive growth of cells, genetic changes including amplification of the MYCN gene, and the formation of spherical, rosette-like structures under microscopic examination. The elevated levels of dopamine and homovanillic acid in the blood and urine are also indicative of this disease. 

+2. Ganglioneuroblastoma: This is a rare type of tumor that forms in nerve tissue. It can occur anywhere along the spine. Symptoms that match include the abnormal growth of cells near the adrenal glands, the cells' tendency to form spherical, rosette-like structures, and the elevated levels of certain substances in the blood and urine, such as dopamine and homovanillic acid. However, this disease is typically less aggressive than what is indicated by the rapid and aggressive growth of cells in the patient.

+3. Pheochromocytoma: This is a rare tumor of adrenal gland tissue. It results in the release of too much adrenaline and noradrenaline, hormones that control heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure.

However, MRKH syndrome does not typically cause abdominal pain.

+2. Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS): This is a condition where a person is genetically male, but is resistant to male hormones. As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman. The patient's symptoms of normal secondary sexual characteristics and absence of menstruation could suggest this condition. However, the patient's karyotype analysis showed a normal female pattern (46,XX), which is not consistent with AIS.

+3. Swyer Syndrome: This is a condition characterized by the failure of the sex glands (i.e., testes in males and ovaries in females) to develop. This can lead to a lack of menstruation and primary amenorrhea. However, this condition is typically associated with a 46,XY karyotype, which does not match the patient's karyotype of 46,XX.

+4. Turner Syndrome: This is a chromosomal condition that alters development in females. Women with this condition tend to be shorter than average and are usually unable to conceive a child because of an absence of ovarian function. However, the patient's normal stature and normal ovaries do not align with this condition. Additionally, Turner Syndrome is associated with a 45,X karyotype, which does not match the patient's karyotype of 46,XX.

+5. Müllerian Agenesis: Also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, this condition is characterized by a failure of the Müllerian duct to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper portion. Müllerian agenesis would explain the patient's primary amenorrhea and the findings on ultrasonography. However, it does not typically cause abdominal pain."
