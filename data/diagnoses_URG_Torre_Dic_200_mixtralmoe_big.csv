Trago positivo.-, Exploracion Compl.: NaN, Evolucion: NaN","Based on the provided information, here are some potential diseases that could be considered:

+1. Acute Otitis Media: This is an infection of the middle ear, which can cause ear pain, hearing loss, and a red, bulging eardrum. The patient's symptoms of otalgia (ear pain) and decreased hearing quality, along with the hyperemic (red) and slightly desquamated (flaky) tympanic membrane (eardrum) on the right side, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the absence of fever and the chronicity of the symptoms (15 days) may not fully support this diagnosis.

+2. Otitis Externa: This is an infection of the ear canal, which can cause ear pain, hearing loss, and a red, swollen ear canal. The patient's symptoms of otalgia and decreased hearing quality, along with the hyperemic ear canal on the right side, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the absence of itching, which is a common symptom of otitis externa, and the chronicity of the symptoms may not fully support this diagnosis.

+3. Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media: This is a chronic infection of the middle ear, which can cause ear pain, hearing loss, and a perforated eardrum with drainage. The patient's symptoms of otalgia and decreased hearing quality, along with the hyperemic tympanic membrane on the right side, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the absence of ear drainage and the chronicity of the symptoms may not fully support this diagnosis.

+4. Eustachian Tube Dysfunction: This is a condition where the Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of the nose, does not open and close properly. This can cause ear pain, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. The patient's symptoms of otalgia and decreased hearing quality are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the absence of a feeling of fullness in the ear and the chronicity of the symptoms may not fully support this diagnosis.

+5. Temporomandibular Joint Disorder: This is a condition that affects the temporomandibular joint, which connects the jaw to the skull. This can cause ear pain, jaw pain, and difficulty chewing. The patient's symptom of otalgia is consistent with this diagnosis. However, the absence of jaw pain and difficulty chewing, and the chronicity of the symptoms may not fully support this diagnosis.

+6. Trigeminal Neuralgia: This is a condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from the face to the brain. This can cause severe, shooting facial pain that can be triggered by touch or movement. The patient's symptom of otalgia is consistent with this diagnosis. However, the absence of severe, shooting facial pain and the chronicity of the symptoms may not fully support this diagnosis.

+7. Referred Pain: This is pain that is felt in a different location than where it originates. The patient's symptom of otalgia could be referred pain from a problem in the neck or jaw. However, the absence of neck or jaw pain and the chronicity of the symptoms may not fully support this diagnosis.

+8. Cerumen Impaction: This is a condition where earwax builds up in the ear canal and becomes hard, causing ear pain and hearing loss. The patient's symptoms of otalgia and decreased hearing quality are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the absence of a visible earwax blockage and the chronicity of the symptoms may not fully support this diagnosis.

The patient's difficulty breathing and hypoventilation align with this condition. However, the patient does not have chest pain or cough, which are common symptoms of pulmonary embolism.

+4. Pneumonia: This is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus. Symptoms include cough, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. The patient's difficulty breathing aligns with this condition. However, the patient does not have a fever, cough, or chills, which are common symptoms of pneumonia.

+5. Heart Failure: This is a chronic condition in which the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet. The patient's difficulty breathing aligns with this condition. However, the patient does not have fatigue or swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, which are common symptoms of heart failure.

+6. Anxiety Disorder: This is a mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry, anxiety, or fear that are strong enough to interfere with one's daily activities.

No focalidad neurológica aguda.-, Exploracion Compl.: NaN, Evolucion: NaN","Based on the provided information, here are some potential diseases that could be considered:

+1. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV): This condition is characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo that are triggered by specific changes in the position of your head. The patient's description of vertigo with a sensation of giro del entorno (spinning of the environment) that is reproduced with changes in posture aligns with this condition. However, the lack of improvement with sulpirida (a medication not typically used for BPPV) and the normal vestibular tests are not consistent with this diagnosis.

+2. Vestibular Migraine: This condition is characterized by vertigo and dizziness, often accompanied by migraine headaches. The patient's report of vertigo without associated cefalea (headache) does not align with this diagnosis. However, vestibular migraines can occur without headache, so this possibility cannot be completely ruled out.

+3. Meniere's Disease: This is an inner ear disorder that can cause vertigo, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. The patient's report of vertigo without associated tinnitus, hearing loss, or ear fullness does not align with this diagnosis.

+5. Labyrinthitis: This is an inner ear disorder that can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. It is often caused by a viral infection. The patient's report of vertigo without associated hearing loss or tinnitus does not align with this diagnosis.

+6. Vestibular Neuronitis: This condition is characterized by sudden, severe vertigo that can last for several days. It is often preceded by a viral infection. The patient's report of vertigo lasting for 5 days without associated symptoms of a viral infection does not align with this diagnosis.

+7. Central Vertigo: This type of vertigo is caused by problems in the brain, such as a stroke or multiple sclerosis. The patient's normal neurological examination does not align with this diagnosis.

+8. Psychogenic Vertigo: This type of vertigo is caused by psychological factors, such as anxiety or depression. The patient's normal mental status examination does not align with this diagnosis.

+9. Drug-Induced Vertigo: Certain medications can cause vertigo as a side effect. The patient's report of vertigo that is not improving with sulpirida (a medication that can cause vertigo) could align with this diagnosis. However, the patient's normal neurological examination does not support this diagnosis.

+10. Cervical Vertigo: This type of vertigo is caused by problems in the neck, such as arthritis or a herniated disc. The patient's normal neurological examination does not align with this diagnosis."

However, the lack of improvement with Algidol (a medication for cough and cold symptoms) suggests a possible complication or a different condition.

+2. Laryngitis: The patient's main complaint of afonia (loss of voice) could indicate laryngitis, an inflammation of the larynx. The absence of fever and the presence of a catarrhal cough also support this diagnosis. However, the lack of improvement with Algidol is not typical for laryngitis.

+1. Pleurisy: This is an inflammation of the lining of the lungs (pleura) that can cause sharp chest pain when breathing in. The patient's symptoms of pain in the left intercostal area only during inspiration align with this condition. However, pleurisy often presents with a dry cough, which the patient does not have.

+2. Costochondritis: This is an inflammation of the cartilage in the rib cage, which can cause localized chest pain. The patient's pain in the left intercostal area during inspiration could suggest this condition. However, costochondritis typically does not worsen with breathing, and the patient does not report any tenderness or swelling in the chest, which are common symptoms.

+3. Pulmonary Embolism: This is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, often caused by blood clots. The patient's difficulty breathing could suggest this condition. However, the patient does not have a high heart rate, low blood oxygen levels, or a high temperature, which are common signs of a pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the D-dimer test, which can help rule out a pulmonary embolism, was normal.

+4. Pneumonia: This is an infection in one or both lungs that can cause difficulty breathing, cough, and fever. The patient's difficulty breathing could suggest this condition. However, the patient does not have a cough, fever, or low blood oxygen levels, which are common symptoms of pneumonia. Additionally, the chest X-ray did not show any signs of pneumonia.

+5. Heart Disease: This is a broad term that covers a range of conditions affecting the heart. The patient's high blood pressure could suggest this condition. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms of heart disease, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or an irregular heartbeat. Additionally, the patient's EKG was normal.

+6. Anxiety Disorder: This is a mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry, anxiety, or fear that are strong enough to interfere with one's daily activities. The patient's difficulty breathing could potentially be a symptom of an anxiety disorder. However, the patient does not report any other symptoms of anxiety, such as feelings of panic, fear, or unease.

+7. Musculoskeletal Pain: This is pain that affects the muscles, ligaments, tendons, and bones. The patient's pain in the left intercostal area during inspiration could suggest this condition. However, the patient does not report any other symptoms of musculoskeletal pain, such as swelling, redness, or warmth in the affected area.

+8. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): This is a chronic digestive disease that occurs when stomach acid or, occasionally, bile flows back (refluxes) into your food pipe (esophagus). The patient's difficulty breathing could potentially be a symptom of GERD. However, the patient does not report any other symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn, chest pain, or a sour taste in the mouth.

+9. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): This is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. The patient's difficulty breathing could suggest this condition. However, the patient does not have a chronic cough, excessive sputum production, or a history of exposure"

+2. Fracture: A fracture is a break in a bone. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the left ankle and foot, as well as the physical examination findings of tenderness and swelling, could be consistent with a fracture. However, the patient's X-ray did not show any evidence of a fracture.

+3. Tendinitis: Tendinitis is inflammation or irritation of a tendon, which is a thick cord that attaches bone to muscle. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the left ankle and foot, as well as the physical examination findings of tenderness and swelling, could be consistent with tendinitis. However, the patient does not have a history of repetitive motion or overuse, which are common causes of tendinitis.

+4. Bursitis: Bursitis is inflammation of a bursa, which is a small fluid-filled sac that cushions the bones, tendons, and muscles near your joints. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the left ankle and foot, as well as the physical examination findings of tenderness and swelling, could be consistent with bursitis. However, the patient does not have a history of repetitive motion or overuse, which are common causes of bursitis.

+5. Arthritis: Arthritis is inflammation of one or more of your joints. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the left ankle and foot, as well as the physical examination findings of tenderness and swelling, could be consistent with arthritis. However, the patient's age and lack of a history of joint pain or stiffness make this diagnosis less likely.

+6. Cellulitis: Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection that can cause pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the affected area. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the left ankle and foot, as well as the physical examination findings of tenderness and swelling, could be consistent with cellulitis. However, the patient does not have a fever or other signs of infection, which are common with cellulitis.

+7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): DVT is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the left ankle and foot, as well as the physical examination findings of tenderness and swelling, could be consistent with DVT. However, the patient does not have a history of recent surgery, prolonged immobility, or other risk factors for DVT.

+8. Gout: Gout is a form of arthritis that is characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in the joints. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the left ankle and foot, as well as the physical examination findings of tenderness and swelling, could be consistent with gout.

Fracture: The patient is a 12-year-old female presenting with a contusion to the second finger of her left hand, which is accompanied by swelling and localized pain. These symptoms align with a potential fracture, especially considering the mechanism of injury (being hit by a ball). However, without the results of the X-ray, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made.

+2. Soft Tissue Injury: The patient's symptoms, including swelling and localized pain in the second finger of her left hand, could also indicate a soft tissue injury, such as a sprain or strain. This would involve damage to the ligaments, tendons, or muscles in the finger. Again, the X-ray results would help differentiate this from a fracture.

+3. Contusion: The patient's main complaint is a contusion to the second finger of her left hand. A contusion is a type of injury that results in a bruise, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms of swelling and localized pain. However, the severity of the injury and whether it involves deeper structures would need to be determined.

+4. Tendon Injury: The patient's symptoms could also suggest a tendon injury, especially if the pain is severe and there is difficulty moving the finger. Tendon injuries can occur due to sudden trauma, such as being hit by a ball. However, this would typically be associated with more severe pain and loss of function, which is not explicitly mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+5. Ligament Injury: The patient's symptoms could also suggest a ligament injury, especially if there is instability in the finger joint. Ligament injuries can occur due to sudden trauma, such as being hit by a ball. However, this would typically be associated with more severe pain and loss of function, which is not explicitly mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+6. Dislocation: The patient's symptoms could also suggest a dislocation, especially if there is visible deformity in the finger. Dislocations can occur due to sudden trauma, such as being hit by a ball. However, this would typically be associated with more severe pain and loss of function, which is not explicitly mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+7. Nerve Injury: The patient's symptoms could also suggest a nerve injury, especially if there is numbness or tingling in the finger. Nerve injuries can occur due to sudden trauma, such as being hit by a ball. However, this would typically be associated with more severe pain and loss of function, which is not explicitly mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+8. Infection: The patient's symptoms could also suggest an infection, especially if there is redness, warmth, or pus at the site of injury. However, the patient's normal temperature and lack of other systemic symptoms make this less likely.

+9. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS): This is a less likely possibility, but the patient's symptoms could potentially suggest CRPS, a condition characterized by severe pain, swelling, and changes in skin color and temperature. However, this condition typically develops after an injury and is not usually associated with a single traumatic event like being hit by a ball.

+10. Osteomyelitis: This is a very unlikely possibility, but the patient's symptoms could potentially suggest osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone. However, this condition typically presents with severe pain, fever, and other systemic symptoms, which are not present in this patient."

+3. Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJ): This condition affects the joint that connects the jaw to the skull, and can cause ear pain. However, it is often accompanied by jaw pain and difficulty chewing, which the patient does not report.

+4. Eustachian Tube Dysfunction: This condition occurs when the Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and upper throat, becomes blocked or does not open properly. Symptoms can include ear pain, a feeling of fullness in the ear, and muffled hearing. The patient's complaint of otalgia is consistent with this condition, but the absence of other symptoms such as muffled hearing is not.

+5. Barotrauma: This condition occurs when there is a difference in pressure between the middle ear and the environment, often during air travel or diving. Symptoms can include ear pain, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the ear.

+6. Ménière's Disease: This is an inner ear disorder that can cause vertigo, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), hearing loss, and ear pain. The patient's complaint of otalgia is consistent with this condition, but the absence of other symptoms such as vertigo and tinnitus is not.

+7. Cholesteatoma: This is a noncancerous growth that can occur in the middle ear, often as a result of repeated infections. Symptoms can include ear pain, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the ear. The patient's complaint of otalgia is consistent with this condition, but the absence of other symptoms such as hearing loss is not.

+8. Acoustic Neuroma: This is a noncancerous growth that can occur on the nerve that connects the inner ear to the brain. Symptoms can include ear pain, hearing loss, and tinnitus. The patient's complaint of otalgia is consistent with this condition, but the absence of other symptoms such as hearing loss and tinnitus is not.

+9. Trigeminal Neuralgia: This condition affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from the face to the brain. Symptoms can include severe, shooting pain in the face, including the ear. However, this condition is typically unilateral and does not cause ear pain without other facial symptoms.

+10. Referred Pain: This is pain that is felt in a location other than where it originates. In this case, the patient's ear pain could be referred from another location, such as the teeth or jaw. However, the patient does not report any other symptoms that would suggest this."

Dental Abscess: This is a collection of pus that forms around the tooth root as a result of a bacterial infection. The patient's main symptom is dental pain, which aligns with this diagnosis. However, the absence of fever and bleeding, which are common symptoms of a dental abscess, may suggest otherwise.

+2. Dry Socket: This is a painful dental condition that can occur after a tooth extraction when the blood clot fails to develop, or it dislodges or dissolves before the wound has healed. The patient's post-surgery dental pain aligns with this diagnosis, but the absence of other symptoms such as bad breath or an unpleasant taste in the mouth may suggest otherwise.

+3. Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJ): This is a pain in the jaw joint that can be caused by a variety of medical problems. The patient's dental pain could be a symptom of TMJ, but the absence of other symptoms such as difficulty chewing, jaw clicking, or locking makes this diagnosis less likely.

+4. Sinusitis: This is an inflammation of the sinuses, which are air spaces behind the bones of the upper face, between the eyes and behind the forehead, nose, and cheeks. Although dental pain can sometimes be a symptom of sinusitis, the absence of other symptoms such as nasal discharge, nasal congestion, or facial pain makes this diagnosis less likely.

+5. Trigeminal Neuralgia: This is a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from your face to your brain. The patient's dental pain could be a symptom of trigeminal neuralgia, but the absence of other symptoms such as sudden, severe facial pain or spasms makes this diagnosis less likely.

+6. Atypical Odontalgia: This is a type of neuropathic pain disorder characterized by chronic pain in the tooth or teeth with no identifiable cause. The patient's dental pain could be a symptom of atypical odontalgia, but the absence of other symptoms such as pain that persists after the tooth has been treated or removed makes this diagnosis less likely.

+7. Osteomyelitis: This is an infection of the bone, a rare but serious condition. The patient's dental pain could be a symptom of osteomyelitis, but the absence of other symptoms such as fever, swelling, or redness makes this diagnosis less likely.

+8. Periodontitis: This is a serious gum infection that damages the soft tissue and destroys the bone that supports your teeth. The patient's dental pain could be a symptom of periodontitis, but the absence of other symptoms such as swollen or bleeding gums, bad breath, or loose teeth makes this diagnosis less likely.

+9. Giant Cell Arteritis: This is a condition that causes inflammation in the walls of your arteries, usually in the scalp, neck, and arms. Although dental pain can sometimes be a symptom of giant cell arteritis, the absence of other symptoms such as jaw pain, vision problems, or headaches makes this diagnosis less likely.

+10. Salivary Gland Infection: This is an infection of one or more of your salivary glands. The patient's dental pain could be a symptom of a salivary gland infection, but the absence of other symptoms such as a bad taste in the mouth, difficulty opening the mouth, or swelling of the face makes this diagnosis less likely."

+1. Fracture of the first metacarpal bone: This is a potential diagnosis given the patient's complaint of a painful and swollen first finger on the left hand, as well as the mention of the first metacarpal bone in the examination. However, the absence of an X-ray report makes it difficult to confirm this diagnosis.

+2. Soft tissue injury: This is another potential diagnosis given the patient's complaint of a painful and swollen first finger on the left hand. Soft tissue injuries can include sprains, strains, and contusions. The absence of an X-ray report makes it difficult to rule out a fracture, but the lack of mention of any deformity or instability in the examination suggests that a soft tissue injury may be more likely.

+3. Dislocation of the first metacarpophalangeal joint: This is a potential diagnosis given the patient's complaint of a painful and swollen first finger on the left hand. Dislocations can occur when the bones in a joint are forced out of their normal position. However, the absence of any mention of joint instability or deformity in the examination makes this diagnosis less likely.

+4. Infection: This is a potential diagnosis given the patient's complaint of a painful and swollen first finger on the left hand. Infections can occur as a result of a break in the skin or from an underlying medical condition. However, the absence of any mention of fever, redness, or warmth in the examination makes this diagnosis less likely.

+5. Osteoarthritis: This is a potential diagnosis given the patient's age and complaint of a painful first finger on the left hand. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that can affect any joint in the body, including the fingers. However, the absence of any mention of joint stiffness or limited range of motion in the examination makes this diagnosis less likely.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that can cause joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. However, the absence of any mention of joint stiffness or limited range of motion in the examination makes this diagnosis less likely.

+7. Gout: This is a potential diagnosis given the patient's complaint of a painful first finger on the left hand. Gout is a type of arthritis that can cause sudden and severe joint pain, swelling, and redness. However, the absence of any mention of joint redness or warmth in the examination makes this diagnosis less likely.

+8. Psoriatic arthritis: This is a potential diagnosis given the patient's complaint of a painful first finger on the left hand. Psoriatic arthritis is a type of arthritis that can occur in people with psoriasis, a skin condition. However, the absence of any mention of skin changes or a history of psoriasis in the examination makes this diagnosis less likely.

+9. Reactive arthritis: This is a potential diagnosis given the patient's complaint of a painful first finger on the left hand. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that can occur after an infection in another part of the body. However, the absence of any mention of a recent infection or other symptoms of reactive arthritis in the examination makes this diagnosis less likely.
