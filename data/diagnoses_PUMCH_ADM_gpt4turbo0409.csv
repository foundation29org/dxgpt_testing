"['Neonatal Marfan syndrome', 'Marfan syndrome']","Based on the symptom of 'Kyphoscoliosis' you've provided, here are some potential diseases and conditions that could be associated with this symptom. I will list each disease with a brief description and specify which symptoms match and which do not:

+1. Marfan Syndrome:
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, which helps hold all the body’s cells, organs, and tissue together and also plays an important role in helping the body grow and develop properly. Common symptoms include long limbs, flexible joints, and abnormal spinal curvature such as kyphoscoliosis. 
- Common symptoms with the patient: Kyphoscoliosis.
- Symptoms not observed in the patient: Long limbs, flexible joints.

+2. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome:
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. It often leads to hypermobility, stretchy skin, and abnormal scar formation. Kyphoscoliosis can be a feature, particularly in the kyphoscoliotic type.
- Common symptoms with the patient: Kyphoscoliosis.
- Symptoms not observed in the patient: Hypermobile joints, stretchy skin.

+3. Osteogenesis Imperfecta:
Osteogenesis Imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, is a congenital disorder characterized by fragile bones that break easily. It can also lead to kyphoscoliosis due to weak bones and poor muscle tone supporting the spine.
- Common symptoms with the patient: Kyphoscoliosis.
- Symptoms not observed in the patient: Fragile bones, frequent fractures.

+4. Neuromuscular Scoliosis:
Neuromuscular scoliosis is a type of scoliosis that arises due to abnormal muscles or nerves. Frequently seen in people with conditions like cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, it can manifest as kyphoscoliosis where there is both lateral and kyphotic curvature of the spine.
- Common symptoms with the patient: Kyphoscoliosis.
- Symptoms not observed in the patient: Muscle weakness, neurological abnormalities.

+5. Scheuermann's Disease:
Scheuermann's disease is a developmental disorder of the spine where the vertebrae grow unevenly with respect to the sagittal plane; this is, the vertebrae grow more in front or back than on the sides. This uneven growth results in the signature ""wedging"" shape of the vertebrae, leading to kyphoscoliosis.
- Common symptoms with the patient: Kyphoscoliosis.
- Symptoms not observed in the patient: Pain in the thoracic region, reduced flexibility in the spine.

Each of these diseases could potentially explain the presence of kyphoscoliosis, but further diagnostic tests such as genetic testing, imaging studies, and a thorough physical examination would be necessary to narrow down the exact cause and confirm the diagnosis."
