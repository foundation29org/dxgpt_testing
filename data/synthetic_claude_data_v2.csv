Disease,Detailed
Down syndrome,"The parents report that their infant has been slow to reach developmental milestones, including delayed motor skills like rolling over and sitting up. On exam, subtle dysmorphic facial features are noted, including upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, a flattened nasal bridge, and a protruding tongue. The patient presents with generalized hypotonia. A heart murmur is appreciated on auscultation. Though a definitive diagnosis cannot be made based on clinical findings alone, these features raise suspicion for an underlying genetic syndrome and warrant referral for genetic testing and evaluation by a pediatric specialist."
Neural tube defect,"The patient presents with concerns of lower back pain and possible weakness or numbness in the legs. Upon examination, notable findings include a sacral dimple or hair tuft over the spine, possible asymmetry of the gluteal muscles, and decreased muscle strength or sensation in the lower extremities. The patient may have a history of inadequate folic acid intake around the time of conception. Further imaging such as an MRI would be warranted to evaluate for presence of a spinal cord malformation such as spina bifida."
Cleft lip/palate,"The patient presents with concerns about facial asymmetry since birth, reporting difficulty feeding and nasal regurgitation of liquids. The parents note an unusual shape to the upper lip and concerns that speech development seems delayed. Examination reveals a unilateral cleft of the upper lip and hard palate, with nasal airflow visible when the child cries. There is poor coordination of suck and swallow noted during feeding evaluation."
Tumor of endocrine glands,"The patient presents with fatigue, unexpected weight changes, feeling cold, constipation, emotional changes such as irritability or depression, muscle weakness, and dry skin and hair. Physical exam shows slowed reflexes, low blood pressure, a slow heart rate, puffiness around the eyes, enlarged thyroid, and loss of the outer part of the eyebrow. Lab tests show elevated TSH, low T3 and T4, elevated cholesterol, anemia, and vitamin deficiencies. These nonspecific findings warrant further investigation to reach a definitive diagnosis."
Cleft palate,"The patient presents with concerns about difficulty feeding and nasal regurgitation when bottle feeding their infant. Upon examination, a cleft is noted in the roof of the mouth. The parents report the child has difficulty creating suction and milk leaks out the nose when feeding. There is a visible defect between the lip and gum where the palate did not properly fuse during development in utero. The child cries excessively during feedings. Weight gain has been poor since birth."
"Renal agenesis, unilateral",The patient presents with flank pain and recurrent urinary tract infections. Lab work shows reduced glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria.
