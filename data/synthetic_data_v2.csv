Disease,Detailed
Down syndrome,"The patient presents with distinctive facial features such as flattened facial profile, upward slanting eyes, and a protruding tongue. Additional physical features include a single crease across the palm, low muscle tone and short stature. The patient also exhibits cognitive and developmental delays, as evidenced by slower learning and speech development compared to peers. There are also concerns about potential heart defects, which are common in individuals with similar symptoms. The patient's parents report that despite these issues, the child shows a generally happy demeanor and social nature, but has difficulty with tasks that require fine motor skills. Moreover, the patient demonstrates increased susceptibility to respiratory, hearing and vision problems."
Neural tube defect,"The new patient presents with issues like muscle weakness and lack of coordination, particularly in the lower limbs, in addition to urinary or bowel incontinence. They may also complain of unusual sensations in the legs, such as numbness or tingling. Notable physical findings include an abnormal curvature of the spine, such as scoliosis, and a visible defect on the lower back, which can take the form of a small patch of hair, a dimple, or a birthmark. The patient may also have a history of frequent urinary tract infections. These symptoms and findings could indicate a yet undiagnosed condition affecting the development of the spine and spinal cord."
Cleft lip/palate,"A new patient presents with a history of feeding difficulties such as excessive drooling, food or liquids coming out of the nose during feeding, and frequent ear infections. The patient's parents also mention speech difficulties and delay in language development. The patient has abnormal facial features including asymmetry of the lips, a gap or indentation in the lip or palate, and a prominent or bifid uvula. The dental examination reveals misaligned or missing teeth. Upon hearing and speech evaluation, the patient is found to have nasal sounding speech and hearing loss."
Tumor of endocrine glands,"The patient presents with a variety of nonspecific symptoms that include persistent fatigue, weakness, rapid or unexplained weight changes, and changes in appetite. They may also exhibit mood changes, irritability, and difficulties in concentration. Physical examination may reveal skin changes such as unusual pigmentation or excessive sweating. The patient may also complain of frequent urination, persistent thirst, and may present with a high blood pressure reading. Depending on the specific gland affected, symptoms may include intolerance to cold or heat, changes in menstrual cycle for women, sexual dysfunction in men, or unexplained growth in hands and feet. Routine blood tests may indicate abnormal levels of hormones, such as thyroid hormone, cortisol, insulin, or others."
Cleft palate,"The new patient presents with a range of symptoms including difficulties with feeding, such as excessive air intake leading to gas and frequent ear infections. The patient also struggles with speech, often producing nasal-sounding or unclear words. Upon physical examination, there is a notable gap or split in the roof of the mouth that extends into the patient's nose, and the soft and hard palate may appear incomplete. The patient's teeth are also misaligned and there may be an abnormal facial appearance. Furthermore, hearing loss may be evident due to frequent middle ear fluid build-up and infections. These symptoms have been persistent since birth."
"Renal agenesis, unilateral","The patient may report symptoms such as fatigue, back or side pain, and high blood pressure, which could be attributed to various conditions. The patient may also have a history of recurrent urinary tract infections or kidney stones. Physical examination may reveal a palpable mass in the abdomen, suggesting enlargement of one kidney. Blood and urine tests may show abnormal results such as high levels of protein or blood in the urine, or elevated creatinine or urea levels in the blood, indicating impaired kidney function. Imaging tests such as ultrasound or CT scan may reveal the absence of one kidney and compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining kidney."
Pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection,"The patient presents with a recent-onset of persistent cough that is often productive of greenish or bloody mucus, difficulty breathing, and chest pain that worsens with coughing or inhaling deeply. Accompanying these respiratory symptoms are systemic signs such as fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite, sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. On physical examination, the patient has increased respiratory rate and may exhibit signs of respiratory distress. Auscultation of the chest may reveal crackles or decreased breath sounds. The patient may also have a history of recent hospitalization, antibiotic use, or has a chronic lung disease, all of which could increase susceptibility to certain types of infections."
"47,XYY syndrome","The patient, a young male, presents with significant height overgrowth, with a height percentile that is notably above the average for his age group. He demonstrates difficulties in learning, particularly in areas that require language and speech skills, and his parents report behavioral issues such as impulsivity, difficulty in social interaction, and attention deficit. He has a history of delayed motor skills development, and some minor physical anomalies such as increased acne and large teeth. His parents have also noted that he seems to have a lower energy level compared to his peers. Despite the above, the patient has normal sexual development and fertility. These findings could indicate a chromosomal condition that is not immediately apparent without specific genetic testing."
Iniencephaly ,"The patient, an infant, presents with extreme retroflexion of the head, where the skull appears to be bent backwards towards the spine. This is accompanied by severe deformities of the spine, notably a short neck and large defects in the area where the skull and spine connect. The patient may also exhibit facial anomalies such as a flat nose, cleft lip and palate, and missing eyes or abnormally small eyes. Additionally, the infant may have difficulty breathing and swallowing, and may show signs of developmental delay. Despite these significant symptoms, the patient does not appear to be in any pain. However, these symptoms are serious, and the prognosis is generally poor."
Rare cutaneous lupus erythematosus,"The patient presents with a series of persistent and unexplained skin rashes, primarily located on areas exposed to the sun, such as the face, scalp, and extremities. These rashes appear as raised, red, scaly patches that sometimes present with a butterfly-shaped pattern across the cheeks and nose. In addition to the rashes, the patient might report experiencing fatigue, unexplained fever, and joint pain, which don't seem to be linked to any known allergies, recent illnesses, or physical injuries. There may also be reports of unusual hair loss or mouth ulcers. These symptoms have been recurring for a few months and have not responded to over-the-counter treatments or home remedies."
Congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens,"A young adult male patient presents with a history of recurrent respiratory infections since childhood, including pneumonia and bronchitis. He also describes a persistent productive cough with thick mucus, and has been diagnosed with bronchiectasis. In addition, the patient reports a long-standing history of infertility despite having normal sexual function and normal secondary sexual characteristics. Upon physical examination, the vas deferens is not palpable bilaterally. Semen analysis reveals azoospermia, and sweat chloride test indicates high levels of chloride, suggestive of a possible underlying genetic condition."
Ovarian cancer,"The patient might present with a variety of non-specific symptoms that have been persistent and worsening over a period of time. These might include persistent bloating, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, and abdominal or pelvic pain. She could also report urinary symptoms such as urgency or frequency. Some might even experience changes in bowel habits, unexplained weight loss or fatigue. Upon physical examination, an inexplicable increase in abdominal girth, as well as palpable abdominal or pelvic masses could be identified. Diagnostic findings might show increased levels of the tumor marker CA-125 in blood tests. Imaging studies such as CT scans or ultrasounds might reveal abnormal growths or masses in the ovaries."
Primary Sjögren syndrome,"The patient presents with complaints of persistent dryness in the mouth and eyes, causing a sensation of grittiness or a burning feeling in the eyes, as well as difficulty swallowing or speaking due to lack of saliva. They may also report fatigue, joint pain, and swelling. Notable findings may include dental decay, swollen salivary glands, and inflammation in the eyes. Some patients may also experience dryness affecting other parts of the body such as the throat, nose, skin, or vagina. The patient's symptoms may have been dismissed as side effects of medications or natural aging, despite their chronic and pervasive nature."
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"The patient presents with persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and a sense of discomfort or fullness in the abdomen. They also complain of recurrent infections and fever, which may indicate a compromised immune system. Physical examination reveals enlarged, non-tender lymph nodes in the neck, axilla, and groin. The spleen may also be palpable due to splenomegaly. Additionally, the patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, indicated by low red blood cell count and platelet count respectively. The complete blood count (CBC) shows a high number of lymphocytes, and a peripheral blood smear reveals an abundance of mature lymphocytes and presence of smudge cells."
Congenital hydrocephalus,"The patient, an infant, has been exhibiting a rapid increase in head circumference, surpassing the normal range for their age and gender. The caregivers have also noted a bulging or tense soft spot (fontanel) on the top of the baby's head. The patient presents with downward gaze, known as ""sunsetting eyes,"" and appears to have developmental delays, showing poor feeding, vomiting, irritability, sleepiness, and seizures. Physical examination reveals an unusually large head, with a thin and shiny scalp with visible veins. Further neurological examination indicates poor muscle tone and strength, and a distinct lack of response to touch and sound."
Necrotizing enterocolitis,"The patient, a neonate, presents with nonspecific symptoms including poor feeding, abdominal distension, and decreased bowel movements. They appear lethargic, with a notable decrease in activity levels. Examination reveals a tender, swollen abdomen and bloody stools are noted. The infant also exhibits signs of sepsis, including temperature instability, lethargy, and apnea. The parents note that the baby has been vomiting a greenish substance. The infant, who was premature and formula-fed, has been progressively losing weight and has not been gaining weight as expected. Despite these alarming symptoms, initial lab results and imaging have not provided a clear diagnosis."
Preeclampsia,"A new patient arrives at primary care presenting with symptoms such as sudden and persistent headaches, vision problems like blurriness or light sensitivity, and upper abdominal pain, particularly on the right side under the ribs. She also mentions experiencing rapid weight gain, particularly more than 2 pounds in a week, accompanied by severe swelling of her hands, face, and legs, which is more than what is typically expected in normal pregnancies. Additionally, she has noted an increase in her blood pressure readings at home. Lab tests reveal protein in her urine and potentially impaired liver and kidney function. The patient is in the late second or third trimester of her pregnancy."
Asherman syndrome,"The patient, a woman of childbearing age, presents with menstrual irregularities such as light or absent periods, which she reports as a new development. She has a history of multiple dilatation and curettage procedures following miscarriages or childbirth. She may also report recurrent miscarriages, pelvic pain, and difficulty conceiving. Physical examination is largely unremarkable, but further investigation might reveal an unusually thin endometrial lining on ultrasound, and hysteroscopic examination could potentially reveal adhesions or scarring in the uterine cavity. There may be no other clear explanation for her symptoms based on her personal and family medical history, her lifestyle, or other diagnostic testing."
Renal dysplasia,"The patient presents with a range of non-specific symptoms including recurrent urinary tract infections, hypertension and persistent lower back pain. Physical examination reveals enlarged kidneys and palpable masses in the renal region. Laboratory tests indicate elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, suggesting impaired kidney function. Urinalysis shows proteinuria and hematuria, while ultrasound imaging reveals abnormal kidney structure, including cysts and an irregular, uneven size and shape of the kidneys. Genetic testing also indicates the presence of mutations associated with kidney malformations. Despite these symptoms, the patient does not have a definitive diagnosis."
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"The patient presents with a variety of non-specific symptoms that have become increasingly persistent over the past few weeks. These symptoms include unexplained weight loss, night sweats and recurrent fever. On examination, there are palpable, non-tender, swollen lymph nodes, most noticeably in the neck and armpit regions. The patient also reports persistent fatigue and a noticeable loss of appetite. Blood tests reveal anemia and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. An abdominal ultrasound identifies some splenic enlargement. The patient does not have a known history of any serious illnesses, infections or immune disorders. The constellation of these signs and symptoms, along with the mentioned blood test and imaging findings, suggest a possible hematologic malignancy."
Trisomy X,"The patient, a young female, presents with a history of delayed developmental milestones, particularly in speech and language, and exhibits mild to moderate learning disabilities. She might also display symptoms of anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit disorder. Physically, she is taller than average for her age with a higher prevalence of minor physical anomalies such as epicanthal folds, hypertelorism, upslanting palpebral fissures and clinodactyly. She may also have seizures and menstrual irregularities. Despite these symptoms, this patient's physical appearance would typically fall within normal variation and she has no major malformations or dysmorphic features. Hence, this condition might have been overlooked during her earlier years."
Scleroderma,"The patient has been experiencing progressive tightening and hardening of the skin, notably on their hands and face. They complain of Raynaud's phenomenon, characterized by their fingers turning white or blue in response to cold or stress. They also report persistent heartburn and difficulty swallowing, indicating possible esophageal problems. Additionally, they also mention bouts of fatigue, weakness, and unintended weight loss. Upon physical examination, the doctor observes skin changes such as thickened patches and unusual areas of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. The patient's medical history reveals gradual onset of symptoms over the past several months."
Non-immune hydrops fetalis,"The patient's primary complaints include noticeable swelling or edema in two or more areas, such as the abdomen, scalp, arms or legs. Additionally, the patient may present with symptoms of anemia such as fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath. In severe cases, the patient may also exhibit signs of congestive heart failure which include rapid breathing, increased heart rate, and liver enlargement. Additionally, fetal ultrasound may reveal fluid accumulation in abnormal areas such as the pleural cavity, pericardial sac, and the abdomen. Decreased movement or lethargy may also be reported. High output heart failure could be evident on echocardiography."
Renal cell carcinoma,"The patient presents with nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss and a general feeling of being unwell. They also report experiencing persistent lower back pain on one side that is not associated with injury or physical strain. The patient also mentions having a fever that comes and goes without any apparent cause. During physical examination, the doctor might notice a mass or lump in the abdominal area. In addition, the patient has recently noticed blood in their urine, causing it to appear pink, red or cola-colored. Lab tests might report anemia or abnormal liver function."
Genetic peripheral neuropathy,"The patient presents with complaints of recurring numbness, tingling, pain, and muscle weakness, primarily in the extremities. These symptoms have been noticed to be progressively worsening over a period of time. The patient also reports a decrease in overall coordination, leading to frequent trips and falls. An examination reveals a decrease in both muscle mass and reflexes, particularly in the feet and hands. A notable detail revealed during the medical history taking is the presence of similar symptoms in other family members, suggesting a possible hereditary condition. Additional findings include reduced sensitivity to temperature and touch during sensory testing, and abnormal results from nerve conduction studies and electromyography, indicating abnormal peripheral nerve function."
Cardiogenic shock,"The patient presents with complaints of persistent fatigue, sudden and severe shortness of breath, even at rest, and episodes of rapid, irregular heartbeat. They also report experiencing frequent episodes of lightheadedness, fainting, and a general feeling of weakness. Physical examination reveals cold and sweaty skin, a rapid pulse, low blood pressure, and reduced urine output. The patient also shows signs of mental confusion and has a bluish tinge to lips and nails indicating a lack of oxygen in the body. A cardiac examination further reveals a faint heart sound, potentially suggestive of a significant decrease in cardiac output. Despite these symptoms, no clear diagnosis has been established."
Acute sensorineural hearing loss by acute acoustic trauma or sudden deafness or surgery induced acoustic trauma,"The patient could present sudden unexplained hearing loss, often noticed upon waking up, or it may occur over a period of a few days. They may also complain of a loud pop or click before hearing loss begins, and may experience tinnitus (ringing in the ears), vertigo, or a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear. They may have difficulty understanding speech, particularly in noisy environments or when the speaker is not directly facing them. The patient might have a recent history of exposure to loud noise, sudden pressure changes, such as in air travel, or recent surgery, particularly if it involved the head or neck."
AL amyloidosis,"The patient presents with a vague set of symptoms that have been gradually worsening over time. They complain of unexplained fatigue, shortness of breath, and significant weight loss without changes in diet or exercise. Additionally, they note occasional episodes of light-headedness and fainting, and have been experiencing swelling in their ankles and legs. Upon physical examination, there are signs of an enlarged tongue and irregular heartbeat. Lab results indicate protein in the urine and an elevated BNP level, suggesting possible heart and kidney involvement. Despite the diverse range of symptoms, there seems to be no clear underlying cause, making the diagnosis complex."
Hepatitis delta,"The patient may present with non-specific symptoms including fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. They may also report experiencing joint pain and jaundice, a condition characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes. Distinctive physical examination findings may include hepatomegaly, or an enlarged liver, along with potential signs of liver disease like ascites and spider angiomas. The patient may also have a history of exposure to blood or body fluids, intravenous drug use, or unprotected sex, which would increase their risk for bloodborne infections. Laboratory findings may reveal elevated liver enzymes, indicating liver inflammation or damage."
Fetal cytomegalovirus syndrome,"A new patient presents with nonspecific symptoms such as lethargy, loss of appetite, and jaundice. Upon further examination, there are notable findings of hepatosplenomegaly (an enlarged liver and spleen) and petechiae, small red or purple spots on the body caused by minor hemorrhages. The patient may also exhibit microcephaly, a condition where the head circumference is smaller than normal, and signs of intrauterine growth restriction. Other findings may include ocular abnormalities such as chorioretinitis and optic atrophy, hearing loss, and neurological abnormalities such as seizures or developmental delays. These symptoms and findings could suggest an intrauterine infection occurred during pregnancy."
Romano-Ward syndrome,"The patient may present with complaints of sudden, unexplained episodes of fainting, palpitations, or seizures, particularly during physical activity or emotional stress. They might describe a history of sudden death in the family, particularly in young relatives. On examination, the patient’s baseline vital signs would likely appear normal; however, an electrocardiogram (ECG) may reveal a prolonged QT interval, even in the absence of any structural heart abnormalities. Despite these alarming symptoms, the patient's physical examination would generally be unremarkable, with no overt signs of congenital heart disease, and they may not display any symptoms between episodes."
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,"The patient presents with complaints of dull or severe pain in their back or side, recurrent urinary tract infections, and blood in their urine. Additionally, they mention episodes of high blood pressure, frequent urination, and kidney stones. Upon physical examination, there is noted abdominal or flank tenderness, suggesting possible enlargement of the kidneys. There might also be a family history of similar symptoms or kidney disease. Diagnostic tests reveal multiple cysts in the kidneys and sometimes the liver or pancreas. There are also indications of kidney dysfunction such as elevated creatinine levels."
Congenital pulmonary valvar stenosis,"The patient, a young child, presents with a history of unexplained fatigue and shortness of breath, especially during physical activities. The parents might also report that the child seems to have abnormal growth patterns or developmental delays when compared to peers. Notably, upon physical examination, the physician may detect a heart murmur, specifically a systolic ejection murmur, upon auscultation. The patient may also display signs of cyanosis, a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to low oxygen levels. Further diagnostic testing such as EKG or echocardiogram may show abnormalities consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy or post-stenotic dilation."
Uveitis,"The patient presents with persistent eye redness, blurred vision, and a sensitivity to light, all of which have been increasing in intensity over the past few days. They have also mentioned having a mild eye pain and headaches. Upon examination, there is noticeable inflammation around the eye, and a closer look reveals small, floating spots in their field of vision. Despite these symptoms, there is no evidence of trauma or infection, and the patient has no prior history of eye diseases. These symptoms and findings are unexplained, warranting further investigation."
Congenital hypothyroidism,"The patient, a newborn, presents with symptoms including poor feeding, excessive sleepiness, constipation, and prolonged jaundice. They appear to have a puffy face and a large, protruding tongue, and their skin seems to be cold and mottled. Notably, the infant is showing signs of poor growth and has a weak or hoarse cry. Upon examination, there is a noticeable absence of a typical startle response and diminished muscle tone. The baby also exhibits a delayed reaction to stimuli, and there is a concern about their slow heart rate. Despite their lethargic state, the baby is not losing weight but isn't gaining either. The mother of the baby has a history of thyroid problems."
Moderate and severe traumatic brain injury,"The patient may present with a history of recent head trauma or injury, possibly due to a fall, motor vehicle accident, or sports injury. They may express complaints of persistent headaches, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. Cognitive and behavioral changes might also be evident, such as memory problems, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, irritability, and unusual mood swings. Physical examination could reveal signs like loss of coordination, slurred speech, dilated pupils, or problems with vision. In more severe cases, the patient may have experienced seizures or loss of consciousness, and may show signs of confusion, restlessness, or agitation. There could also be noticeable weakness or numbness on one side of the body, suggesting possible neurological damage."
22q11.2 deletion syndrome,"The patient presents with a history of recurrent infections, speech and language delays, and learning disabilities, suggesting possible issues with immune and cognitive functions. Physical examination reveals distinctive facial features such as elongated face, almond-shaped eyes, and a small mouth. Additionally, the patient has a history of congenital heart defects and palatal abnormalities, specifically velopharyngeal insufficiency, resulting in nasally speech. The patient also exhibits mild growth retardation, hypocalcemia, and behavioral issues like anxiety and attention deficit. These findings collectively suggest a possible chromosomal disorder."
Primary congenital hypothyroidism,"The new patient, a neonate, presents with non-specific symptoms which include jaundice that extends beyond the first week of life, constipation, and poor feeding. The child appears to be lethargic, with decreased activity and excessive sleeping. Physical examination reveals a large fontanelle, wide nasal bridge, and a distended abdomen with a noticeable umbilical hernia. Despite being a full-term infant, the child exhibits slow growth and delayed developmental milestones. The infant also has a hoarse cry, myxedematous facies, and cold, mottled skin. The parents report that the child has difficulty in breathing and seems to choke often, possibly due to macroglossia. The child also seems to have hypotonia, or low muscle tone, and is not gaining weight at an expected rate."
Follicular lymphoma,"The patient presents with unexplained fatigue, general weakness, and a noticeable loss of appetite. Additionally, they report significant weight loss over a short period without trying. On physical examination, they have painless swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, or groin area, which have been gradually increasing in size over the past few months. The patient also complains of recurrent episodes of fever and night sweats. On further examination, the physician notes an enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and liver (hepatomegaly). The patient has no known allergies, no recent infections or injuries, and their medical history is otherwise unremarkable. An initial blood count shows abnormalities including anemia and an elevated number of lymphocytes."
Hemorrhagic fever-renal syndrome,"The patient presents with high fever, severe headache, back pain, abdominal pain, and sometimes blurred vision. The patient may also report experiencing flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, or a rash. They may describe symptoms of nausea and vomiting, potentially leading to severe weight loss. Additionally, the patient may indicate recent outdoor activities or travel in areas known for rodent infestation. Upon physical examination, the physician may note low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and signs of early kidney dysfunction such as low urinary output, proteinuria or hematuria. Lab findings may reveal thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis. The patient's symptoms seem to be severe and are not responding to general symptomatic treatment."
Non-papillary transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder,"The patient presents with persistent and recurrent urinary symptoms that include increased frequency of urination, urgency, and a burning sensation or pain during urination. The most concerning symptom is the presence of blood in the urine (hematuria), which may be visible or only detectable through microscopic examination. The patient might also experience lower abdominal or back pain. However, there are no symptoms of urinary obstruction like difficulty in urinating or a weak urine stream. It's also worth noting that these symptoms have not been accompanied by a fever or weight loss, and there are no signs of upper urinary tract involvement such as flank pain or kidney-related symptoms."
High-grade dysplasia in patients with Barrett esophagus,"The patient may present with a persistent and recurring heartburn, often described as a burning sensation in the chest. Other symptoms can include difficulty swallowing, unexplained weight loss, and possibly regurgitation or vomiting. They may have a long history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and may not respond adequately to conventional GERD treatments. On endoscopy, the lower part of the esophagus may appear reddened and different from the normal pink color of the esophagus, suggestive of a condition known as Barrett's esophagus. The biopsy taken during endoscopy may show changes in the cells lining the esophagus, indicative of a significant cellular abnormality."
Aorta coarctation,"The patient presents with complaints of frequent headaches, unusual fatigue, and occasional shortness of breath, especially during physical activities. On examination, the patient has high blood pressure, notably higher in the arms than in the legs. There is also an observable difference in the strength of the pulse between the upper and lower extremities. Upon auscultation, the physician identifies a heart murmur, and the patient seems to have a noticeable puffiness or swelling of the ankles, feet, and legs. Their medical history reveals that these symptoms have been recurrent but were previously dismissed as stress-related."
Uremic pruritus,"The patient presents with persistent, generalized itching, particularly worse at night, that is not accompanied by any visible skin rash or lesions. This symptom has been causing significant distress, disturbing sleep, and reducing the quality of life. The patient also reports a history of long-standing hypertension and has been feeling increasingly fatigued, with a decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss. Laboratory investigations reveal an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function. A urine test further demonstrates proteinuria and hematuria. Furthermore, the patient has mild anemia and an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Despite the absence of a definitive diagnosis upon arrival, these clinical indications suggest a systemic condition with renal involvement."
Radiation proctitis,"The patient could present with complaints of rectal bleeding, chronic diarrhea, and persistent rectal or abdominal discomfort. He or she may also report a history of cancer treatments involving radiation therapy, which is a notable risk factor. Upon examination, the mucous lining of the rectum may appear inflamed, and the patient may have a positive fecal occult blood test. Further diagnostic tests may reveal changes in bowel habits, mucus discharge, or tenesmus. Other related findings could include anemia secondary to potential chronic blood loss and malnutrition due to inability to absorb nutrients effectively. These symptoms and findings are indicative of a condition involving inflammation and damage of the rectum."
Osteochondritis dissecans,"The patient, who has not received a clear diagnosis thus far, presents with persistent joint pain, particularly in the knee, that seems to worsen with activity and eases with rest. They have also noticed a slight swelling around the joint and occasional joint stiffness, especially in the mornings. The patient describes a sensation of the joint 'catching' or 'locking', and there is a decrease in range of motion. On examination, the joint may present with tenderness, effusion or a palpable loose body, and there may be evidence of joint instability. The patient might mention a history of repetitive trauma or sports injury, but there are no immediate signs of injury or inflammation."
Isolated anencephaly/exencephaly,"The new patient is an infant who presents with several serious and remarkable physical abnormalities. Most notably, there is a significant portion of the skull missing, which is accompanied by the absence of a major part of the brain. The brain tissue that is present appears to be abnormally exposed or covered with a thin membrane. The infant may also display facial feature abnormalities, such as a cleft lip or palate, poorly formed nose, and close-set eyes. The baby may have difficulty with automatic functions like breathing and may not respond to stimuli in a normal manner. It's important to note that despite these severe abnormalities, the baby's other organs and body systems may appear to be developing normally."
Eosinophilic esophagitis,"The patient presents with persistent troubles swallowing, often feeling like food is stuck in their throat after eating, known as dysphagia, and chronic heartburn that has not responded to traditional gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) treatments. They have also reported experiencing chest pain that is not related to the heart. Upon examination, the esophagus may appear to have rings or furrows, and white blood cell count could show elevated levels of eosinophils. There may also be evidence of food impaction, which is food getting stuck in the throat, in their medical history. Despite these symptoms, they exhibit no clear diagnosis upon arrival."
Tetralogy of Fallot,"A new patient arrives at primary care with complaints of recurring episodes of cyanosis (a bluish discoloration of the skin), especially during feeding or crying, along with noticeable shortness of breath and fainting spells. The child seems to have difficulties in gaining weight and is notably fatigued than usual. Upon physical examination, there is a noticeable clubbing of the fingers and toes, a condition often associated with heart disease. An abnormal heart murmur can be heard upon auscultation. These symptoms and physical findings could suggest a complex congenital heart condition characterized by four anatomical abnormalities of the heart."
Neurofibromatosis type 1,"A new patient presents with an array of symptoms that seem unrelated at first glance. The patient reports multiple café-au-lait spots (light brown skin spots), several freckles in the armpit and groin areas, and a number of small, benign growths under the skin, which they describe as ""bumps"". In addition, the patient has a history of learning difficulties and has noticed an increasing difficulty in vision, potentially related to an optic glioma. The patient also mentions a family history of similar symptoms. All of these findings could suggest an underlying genetic disorder."
Permanent congenital hypothyroidism,"The patient, a young child, presents with symptoms including poor growth and developmental delay. Parents report that the child seems to be progressing more slowly than their peers in terms of both physical size and cognitive abilities. They also mention that the child often appears lethargic, with low energy levels, and suffers from constipation. Upon examination, the child has a puffy face and dry skin. Notably, the child is exhibiting a failure to thrive and has a hoarse cry, a large protruding tongue, and an umbilical hernia. Lab tests reveal an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and a low level of thyroxine (T4)."
Congenital toxoplasmosis,"The patient presents with a variety of nonspecific symptoms such as general malaise, fever, and lymphadenopathy. On examination, there may be signs of hepatosplenomegaly, while the patient might also report intermittent headaches and muscle aches. Notably, ocular examination might reveal chorioretinitis, presenting as blurred vision or even visual loss. In infants, there may be signs of developmental delay, jaundice, and seizures. Hearing loss might also be reported in some cases. Laboratory tests may show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. These symptoms and findings suggest a possible systemic infection likely acquired in utero or during birth from an infected mother.
"
Placental insufficiency,"The patient, currently in her second trimester of pregnancy, presents with complaints of abnormal weight gain and consistent sharp abdominal pain. She reports a noticeable decrease in her baby’s movements and has a history of high blood pressure. Upon physical examination, the patient's uterus is measuring smaller than expected for her gestational age. The findings from Doppler ultrasound show an abnormal blood flow pattern in the umbilical artery. Additionally, she shows signs of preeclampsia including swelling in her hands and face, sudden weight gain, and protein in her urine. Despite these signs, the patient's baby has a normal heart rate. The patient's medical history reveals previous pregnancies with similar complications."
Fragile X syndrome,"The patient, particularly a young male, may present with developmental delays, specifically in speech and language acquisition. He may exhibit certain behavioral issues such as hyperactivity, anxiety, and difficulty in focusing attention. Some physical features might be noticeable including prominent ears, a long face, and hyperflexible joints. The patient may also exhibit certain autistic-like behaviors including avoiding eye contact, social anxiety, and engagement in repetitive actions. It is important to note that these symptoms can vary greatly among individuals, and some may not present any noticeable physical features. However, the combination of cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms may indicate a possible genetic condition."
Spinal cord injury,"The patient presents with recent onset of subtle yet progressively worsening symptoms, which include numbness or tingling sensations in their extremities, a noticeable decline in fine motor skills such as buttoning clothes or gripping objects, and difficulty in maintaining balance or coordination. They may also report experiencing unexplained muscle weakness or spasms, particularly in their legs, along with changes in sexual function. There might be instances of uncontrolled bladder or bowel movements and the patient could describe an unusual sensitivity to heat, cold, or touch. The patient's history may reveal a recent event of trauma, fall, or a high-risk activity that could have potentially resulted in injury. Despite these symptoms, physical examination may not immediately indicate a specific underlying condition, necessitating further diagnostic testing."
Sepsis in premature infants,"The infant, born prematurely, arrives in primary care with no clear diagnosis. The main concerns include a high or abnormally low body temperature, rapid heart rate, and quickened breathing. The baby may also exhibit reduced or overactive bowel movements, and a swollen belly. Feeding problems such as reduced appetite, vomiting, or difficulty in swallowing are also prevalent. Other worrisome signs include reduced urine output, a change in skin color, lethargy, irritability, or seizures. Additionally, the infant may have low blood pressure, altered mental status, and abnormal white blood cell count, indicating a possible systemic infection."
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis,"The patient, typically a male child or young adult, presents with a history of recurring eye discomfort which often worsens seasonally, particularly during warm weather. Symptoms include severe itching, redness, and photosensitivity, often accompanied by a foreign body sensation in the eye. He may also report excessive tearing and thick, mucus-like discharge. Upon examination, the conjunctiva appears inflamed and there may be presence of small, round bumps or cobblestone-like protrusions on the upper eyelid. The cornea may also show signs of damage, indicative of a more severe form of the condition. This patient's symptoms and physical findings are suggestive of an allergic eye disease."
Transposition of the great arteries,"The patient, a neonate, has been brought in due to persistent cyanosis, or bluish discoloration of the skin, particularly around the lips and fingertips. This has been coupled with difficulty feeding and rapid breathing, both of which have been increasing in intensity over the past few days. Upon examination, the baby's heart sounds are unusually loud, and there's a murmur detected during the cardiac examination. The baby also appears to be fatigued, with lower activity levels than expected for a neonate. Pulse oximetry readings are significantly low, indicating decreased oxygen levels in the blood. Additionally, the baby is not gaining weight as expected, despite attempts to increase feedings."
Retinitis pigmentosa,"The patient presents with complaints of night blindness and difficulty adapting to low light environments. They also report a gradual loss of their peripheral vision that seems to be progressing over time, described as tunnel vision. They may mention instances of stumbling over objects or bumping into things due to the reduced field of view. Additionally, they may have difficulty discerning colors or experience photopsia, seeing flashes of light. Upon examination, the patient's eyes may show signs of pigmentary changes or clumping in the retina, thinning of the blood vessels, and a waxy appearance of the optic nerve."
Polycythemia vera,"The patient presents with a variety of nonspecific symptoms that have gradually increased in severity over time. The patient reports experiencing fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath even with minimal physical activity. They also express concerns about an unexplained weight loss and frequent night sweats. Upon physical examination, the patient appears to have a ruddy complexion. Abdominal palpation reveals an enlarged spleen, and the patient notes discomfort in the upper left part of their abdominal area. The patient also reports experiencing a feeling of fullness even after consuming small amounts of food. Furthermore, the patient has complained about recurring headaches, dizziness, and visual disturbances. Laboratory results show an elevated hematocrit and hemoglobin level while other tests indicate an increased red blood cell mass. There is also a noted increase in white blood cells and platelet count."
Peripartum cardiomyopathy,"A patient, in her late stages of pregnancy or within the first five months postpartum, presents with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, especially during physical activity, and reports waking up at night feeling out of breath. She may also complain about noticeable swelling in her ankles and feet, and less frequently in her neck veins. Her heart rate is unusually fast even while at rest, and she reports experiencing heart palpitations. Physical examination reveals an increased cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray and possible third heart sound (S3) upon auscultation. There might be evidence of fluid retention in her body such as weight gain and edema. Lab results show elevated levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin. An echocardiogram may reveal left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and an electrocardiogram may reveal tachycardia or other arrhythmias."
Soft tissue sarcoma,"The patient presents with a growing lump or swelling that may or may not be associated with pain, typically located in an extremity, but could also occur in the torso or other areas. The lump may have been present for some time, and the patient may have initially dismissed it as a benign bump or bruise. Recently, however, it has increased in size and may have begun to cause discomfort or even pain. The lump may feel hard and immovable, and could be more than five centimeters in diameter. The patient may also report a feeling of heaviness or fatigue in the affected limb or area. Systemic symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, night sweats, or fever are generally absent. Physical examination reveals a deep-seated, firm mass that is not mobile and is poorly defined. The overlying skin may appear normal or may show signs of discoloration or ulceration. There may also be a limitation of movement if the mass is near a joint or impinges on a nerve or muscle."
Idiopathic hypersomnia,"The patient presents with persistent complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness, despite getting adequate sleep at night. They frequently report long, non-refreshing naps and difficulty waking up, often feeling groggy or disoriented upon awakening. Despite having a good sleep hygiene, they find it difficult to stay awake during the day, impacting their work, school, or daily activities. Their excessive need for sleep is not associated with other health conditions or lifestyle factors and is not relieved by napping or increased nocturnal sleep. Additionally, they may express difficulties with memory, concentration, and mood. Physical examination and initial laboratory tests do not reveal any abnormalities."
Primary systemic amyloidosis,"The patient presents with a constellation of vague, non-specific symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, and generalized weakness. He also reports recent onset of shortness of breath, especially on exertion, and occasional episodes of fainting. On physical examination, there might be findings suggestive of an underlying heart disease, such as irregular heartbeats and enlarged heart, despite the patient having no prior history of cardiac problems. He also shows signs of peripheral neuropathy with numbness and tingling in his hands and feet. Unusual skin changes such as thickening, easy bruising, and purpura (purple patches) might be seen. There might also be evidence of kidney involvement, with the patient reporting foamy urine and tests showing proteinuria. Despite the range of symptoms, no clear underlying cause is immediately apparent."
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,"The patient, a neonate, presents with severe respiratory distress immediately after birth, including rapid breathing, flaring nostrils, and grunting. Despite the absence of cardiac disease, the infant's lips and skin are bluish, suggesting cyanosis. Additionally, the patient exhibits abnormal chest movements, with one side moving less than the other. Upon physical examination, the heart sounds are unusually audible on the right side of the chest, and bowel sounds can be heard in the chest area. The abdomen appears scaphoid or sunken and palpation reveals reduced bowel sounds. Despite the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, there is difficulty in inserting a nasogastric tube."
Partial atrioventricular septal defect,"The patient presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, especially during physical activities, and persistent fatigue. They also report frequent respiratory infections and a notable lack of appetite. Upon examination, signs of fluid retention such as swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet are observed. Cyanosis, a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails, may also be present. The physician notes a heart murmur, an abnormal sound heard during a heartbeat, during auscultation of the chest. The patient's oxygen saturation levels may appear low on pulse oximetry, indicating reduced oxygen supply to the body's tissues. Echocardiogram findings reveal abnormal heart structures, specifically in the heart's upper chambers and valves."
Non-acquired combined pituitary hormone deficiency,"The patient presents with a variety of unspecific complaints such as persistent fatigue, unexplained weight changes, sensitivity to cold, constipation, and a decrease in sexual drive. Upon physical examination, the patient appears small for their age, has a slow growth rate, and presents with delayed puberty. The patient also reports frequent headaches and has visual disturbances, particularly in the peripheral vision. Blood tests reveal low levels of multiple hormones including thyroid hormones, sex hormones, growth hormone, and cortisol. Despite these symptoms, the patient’s family history is non-contributory and there is no significant past medical history to explain the current findings."
Central retinal vein occlusion,"Upon arrival, the patient might present with complaints of a sudden, painless decrease in vision in one eye. This could be accompanied by the perception of floaters, or small moving spots, in the visual field of the affected eye. Notable clinical findings may include retinal hemorrhages observed during a fundoscopic examination, along with dilated and tortuous retinal veins. The patient may also show signs of macular edema, or swelling of the macula, the part of the eye responsible for central, high resolution vision. The presence of cotton wool spots, which are indicative of nerve fiber layer infarcts, might also be noted."
Dermatitis herpetiformis,"A new patient has presented to primary care with a chief complaint of a chronic, intensely itchy rash. On examination, the rash is characterized by clusters of small, red bumps and blisters that are symmetrical and primarily located on the patient's elbows, knees, scalp, buttock, and back. The patient reports periods of improvement and worsening of the rash, but notes that it has been persistent for several months. The patient also mentions experiencing occasional bouts of abdominal discomfort and diarrhea, although these symptoms are less troubling than the persistent rash. The patient also seems to have a family history of autoimmune diseases. Blood tests indicate mild anemia and other routine checkups are normal."
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease,"The patient, who has a history of organ transplantation, presents with a variety of nonspecific complaints. They have reported a marked loss of appetite leading to weight loss and are experiencing recurring episodes of fever and night sweats. The patient also complains of persistent fatigue and weakness. Upon physical examination, there is noticeable swelling in their lymph nodes, particularly in the neck, armpits and groin. Further investigation reveals organ-specific symptoms such as breathlessness, cough, abdominal pain or neurological symptoms. Laboratory tests show abnormal blood cell counts, specifically elevated white cell counts and decreased red cell counts, which may hint towards a hematological condition. The patient’s recent imaging studies also show signs of organomegaly, specifically an enlarged spleen or liver. Despite regular use of immunosuppressants after transplantation, the patient’s symptoms have progressively worsened."
Glial tumor,"The patient may present with various nonspecific complaints that have been progressively worsening over time, such as persistent headaches that are more severe in the morning, frequent episodes of nausea or vomiting, or even some unexplained weight loss. The patient may also report new onset of seizures or changes in their personality or behavior. Neurological examination might reveal subtle deficits such as difficulties with coordination or balance, weakness on one side of the body, or issues with speech or vision. These symptoms are often due to increased intracranial pressure or specific areas of the brain being affected."
Cytomegalovirus disease in patients with impaired cell mediated immunity deemed at risk,"A new patient, deemed at risk due to impaired cell-mediated immunity, may present with non-specific symptoms such as prolonged fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. They may also report experiencing weight loss, night sweats, and possibly a sore throat. On examination, the patient may present with hepatosplenomegaly, or abnormal enlargement of the liver and spleen, and may have atypical lymphocytosis, a higher than normal level of atypical lymphocytes in the blood. Some patients may also exhibit retinitis, inflammation of the retina that can lead to blindness if not treated early. These symptoms and findings are indicative of a potential viral infection that is common in individuals with compromised immune systems."
Thyroid hemiagenesis,"The patient presents with symptoms such as unexplained weight gain, extreme fatigue, and sensitivity to cold. They also report experiencing constipation, dry skin, puffy face, and hoarseness. Upon physical examination, the doctor notes a noticeable asymmetry or enlargement in the neck area, which could indicate some form of thyroid abnormality. The patient's heart rate is slower than average and there's a general lack of energy or lethargy. Blood tests also show high levels of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and low levels of thyroid hormone (T3, T4), suggesting the possibility of a dysfunctional or underactive thyroid. Further radiological imaging may be required to confirm the condition."
Syndactyly type 1,"The patient presents with a notable physical abnormality, specifically in the structure of their hands and/or feet. They report that they were born with this condition and it has been a lifelong concern. Upon examination, it is observed that some of the digits on their hands or feet are fused together, sharing a common skin and, in some cases, even bones. This fusion appears to be more commonly seen in the second and third digits. While the patient has learned to adapt to this condition, they express some difficulty in performing certain tasks that require fine motor skills. The patient's medical history does not indicate any exposure to factors during prenatal development that could have potentially caused this condition."
Bullous pemphigoid,"The patient, upon arrival, presents with itchy, red, and inflamed skin, mostly on the lower abdomen, groin, and axillae, which has been progressively worsening over the past few weeks. On physical examination, the patient exhibits large, tense blisters filled with clear fluid, some of which have ruptured, leaving behind painful, eroded areas. The blistered skin seems to be easily fragile, with new blisters arising from areas of normal-appearing skin or following minor trauma. The patient also reports experiencing mild fatigue and weight loss, but denies having any fever, joint pain, or other systemic symptoms. The patient's oral mucosa and other mucous membranes appear unaffected. The patient's medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and there is no known history of similar symptoms in the family."
Alopecia universalis,"The patient may present with widespread hair loss, not limited to the scalp but including eyebrows, eyelashes, facial hair, body hair, and pubic hair. The initial onset could be rapid and extensive or gradual and subtle, and it's often unpredictable. They might also report changes in the nails, such as pitting or white spots. The patient may express experiencing emotional distress due to the sudden and extensive hair loss. Physical examination would reveal smooth, hairless patches of skin, but without any accompanying inflammation, scarring, or other skin abnormalities. Despite the hair loss, the patient might not have other systemic symptoms or health issues."
Immune thrombocytopenia,"The patient presents to primary care with complaints of spontaneous bruising, petechiae (small red or purple spots on the body), and potentially frequent or unexplained bleeding, such as nosebleeds or bleeding gums. They may also report prolonged bleeding from minor cuts or wounds and heavy or prolonged menstrual periods in women. The patient may seem generally healthy otherwise and does not show signs of any apparent illness. However, blood tests may reveal a significantly lower than normal platelet count, while other blood cell counts remain within the normal range, indicating that the symptoms are not due to a generalized bone marrow problem. The medical history of the patient does not suggest any conditions or medications that are known to decrease platelet counts, pointing to the possibility of an underlying autoimmune process."
Narcolepsy type 1,"The patient presents with excessive daytime sleepiness, experiencing sudden and uncontrollable bouts of sleep during the day, often at inappropriate times and places. These episodes can happen several times a day and are usually brief but refreshing. They report disturbed nighttime sleep and have also experienced episodes of sudden muscle weakness or collapse, particularly during times of strong emotion such as laughter, surprise, or anger. This muscle weakness may affect only certain parts of the body, such as the knees, or may result in a complete physical collapse. The patient may also describe brief episodes of being unable to move or speak while falling asleep or upon awakening, and vivid, dream-like experiences while falling asleep or waking up."
Primary biliary cholangitis,"A middle-aged female patient presents with persistent fatigue and pruritus (itching), especially in her hands and feet. She reports experiencing dry eyes and mouth, and also mentions recent unexplained weight loss. On physical examination, there is no jaundice, but there is hyperpigmentation in the skin. She has a history of remaining illnesses such as hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis. Her blood tests show elevated alkaline phosphatase and cholesterol levels, along with the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies."
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease/Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy,"The patient presents with a history of progressive weakness and muscle atrophy, particularly in the lower legs, leading to foot drop and a high-stepped gait with frequent tripping or falls. They also describe sensory loss, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands - a ""stocking-glove"" sensory loss pattern. Distal muscle weakness and atrophy may also be present in the upper limbs. The patient might have reported family history of similar symptoms, suggesting a potential genetic or hereditary element. Physical examination may reveal decreased deep tendon reflexes, foot deformities such as high arches or hammer toes, and palpably enlarged peripheral nerves. Despite these symptoms, the patient has normal cognitive function and no issues with eye movements or bowel and bladder control."
Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome,"The patient presents with a history of breast lumps, which may be accompanied by changes in the size or shape of the breast, skin dimpling, changes in the nipple or skin texture, or unusual discharge from the nipple. She also reports persistent bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating, or feeling full quickly, which may be indicative of ovarian issues. Notably, she has a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, with several close relatives diagnosed at an early age. The patient herself may have experienced multiple instances of cancer, potentially in both breasts or in other organs as well. She may also report of relatives with male breast cancer or other types of cancers like pancreatic or prostate. These complaints and findings could suggest a possible hereditary predisposition to certain types of cancers."
Neovascular glaucoma,"The patient presents with complaints of a sudden decrease in vision, often described as blurriness or haziness, accompanied by eye pain which may be severe. The individual may also report seeing halos around lights, redness in the eye, and nausea or vomiting, symptoms that can be associated with high intraocular pressure. Upon physical examination, the affected eye may appear red and edematous, the cornea may be cloudy, and the pupil may be mid-dilated and non-reactive to light. Ophthalmoscopic examination may reveal new, abnormal blood vessels on the iris or the angle of the eye, and tonometry may indicate elevated intraocular pressure."
Craniosynostosis,"The new patient, an infant, presents with an unusually shaped skull, characterized by a misshapen, elongated, or asymmetrical appearance, that deviates from the typical roundness expected at this age. The parents have noted a lack of increase in the size of the baby's head despite his continuous growth, and they have further reported a hard, raised ridge along the top of the skull. Additionally, the baby is showing signs of developmental delays, particularly in motor skills, and has been experiencing frequent irritability and difficulty sleeping. The infant's fontanels, the soft spots on his head, are either bulging or closed prematurely. Lastly, upon physical examination, there is evidence of increased intracranial pressure, as indicated by a persistently tense or bulging fontanel when the baby is upright and quiet."
Esophageal atresia,"The new patient, an infant, presents with recurring episodes of coughing, choking, and cyanosis, especially during feedings. The child also exhibits drooling and regurgitation, showing signs of difficulty in swallowing. Despite regular feeding, there is poor weight gain and signs of malnourishment. The infant's symptoms are accompanied by persistent respiratory infections. Upon physical examination, the child has a distended abdomen and upon auscultation, crackles are heard in the lungs, possibly due to aspiration. On further evaluation, using a feeding tube, there seems to be an inability to pass it into the stomach, suggesting a potential gastrointestinal obstruction."
Congenitally uncorrected transposition of the great arteries,"The patient, a young child, presents with persistent, unexplained symptoms of cyanosis, especially noticeable on exertion, and difficulty feeding, often resulting in poor weight gain. Upon examination, the child may have a heart murmur, with other potential signs including a rapid heartbeat or rapid breathing. Blood oxygen levels are found to be unusually low, even when the patient is at rest. Upon further testing, there may be evidence of heart enlargement, or other structural abnormalities of the heart, such as ventricular septal defect. Despite the serious nature of these symptoms, there are no evident external signs of congenital heart disease, such as defects in the structure of the chest or spine."
Non-syndromic anorectal malformation,"The new patient presents with issues related to bowel movements, including chronic constipation or fecal incontinence, signs of discomfort or distress during defecation, or failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life if a newborn. These symptoms may be accompanied by recurring urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence, or unusual urinary stream. Physical examination may reveal anomalies like a poorly developed or absent anal opening, a fistula (abnormal passage) between the rectum and the urinary tract or the skin, presence of the anal opening in an unusual location, or other anomalies in the spine, sacrum, or lower limbs. The patient may also have a history of failed previous anorectal surgery."
Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,"The new patient arrives expressing concerns about persistent, itchy red patches on the skin that have not responded to common treatments for skin conditions. The rashes have been present for several months, and have progressively enlarged and become more inflamed over time. The patient also reports mild fatigue but no other systemic symptoms. Physical examination reveals multiple, well-demarcated erythematous patches scattered across the body, some with a slightly raised surface. The patient has no significant lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. There are no obvious signs of infection, and standard laboratory tests including complete blood cell count and liver function tests are within normal limits. The lack of response to standard dermatological treatments and the chronic nature of the skin changes raise concerns about a more serious underlying condition."
Autoimmune hepatitis,"The patient presents with persistent fatigue, unexplained jaundice, and mild right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She also reports periods of low-grade fever and recent onset of skin rashes. Upon physical examination, the patient exhibits hepatomegaly and mild splenomegaly. Laboratory findings reveal elevated liver transaminases, hypergammaglobulinemia, and presence of autoantibodies, specifically antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA). Liver function tests show an increase in serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient also has a history of other autoimmune diseases."
Multicystic dysplastic kidney,"The patient presents with vague abdominal discomfort and a palpable mass in the abdomen. There may also be associated urinary tract infections, hematuria (blood in urine), or hypertension. Upon physical examination, one kidney may appear enlarged and irregular. The patient may also exhibit failure to thrive or poor growth, especially in pediatric cases. Diagnostic imaging may reveal multiple non-communicating cysts of varying sizes in the affected kidney, and the contralateral kidney may show compensatory hypertrophy. The presence of oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) during prenatal ultrasound scans may also be reported in the patient's medical history, particularly if an infant is being evaluated."
Unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney,"A new patient presents to primary care with abdominal discomfort and a palpable lump in their abdomen, most notably on one side. They express having high blood pressure and may have had recurrent urinary tract infections. Upon examination, the patient also shows signs of failure to thrive and shows growth retardation. They may have had a history of oligohydramnios, or low amniotic fluid, during their mother’s pregnancy. Laboratory findings may indicate impaired renal function, including elevated creatinine levels and potential anemia. An ultrasound reveals multiple non-communicating cysts of varying sizes in one kidney, with the other kidney appearing normal or compensatorily enlarged."
Scarring in glaucoma filtration surgical procedures,"A new patient presents with symptoms indicative of post-surgical complications related to an ocular procedure. The patient complains of gradual vision loss, persistent eye pain and discomfort, and sensitivity to light. On examination, there is evidence of increased intraocular pressure and visual field defects, despite previous surgery aimed at reducing this pressure. The patient's eye also shows signs of inflammation, possible fibrotic tissue development, and reduced functioning of the surgical site, which was meant to facilitate the drainage of intraocular fluid. This pattern of complaints and findings is suggestive of a potential post-surgical complication in the patient's eye."
Pulmonary fungal infections in patients deemed at risk,"The patient, with an elevated risk profile due to potential exposure or a compromised immune system, presents with nonspecific symptoms such as persistent cough, fever, and fatigue that have not been responsive to common treatments. Notable findings may include unexpected weight loss and shortness of breath, coupled with changes in lung sounds upon auscultation. The patient could exhibit signs of a localized infection, such as skin lesions or swollen lymph nodes. Lab results may show elevated inflammatory markers, and imaging studies, such as chest X-ray or CT scan, might reveal certain abnormal pulmonary findings like nodules or infiltrates. These symptoms and findings are indicative of an underlying respiratory condition that requires further investigation."
Pouchitis,"The patient may present with complaints of increased bowel frequency, urgency, nocturnal bowel movements, incontinence, and abdominal pain. They may also report systemic symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, and weight loss. On examination, the patient might appear dehydrated or feverish, and abdominal examination may reveal tenderness, particularly in the lower quadrants. Laboratory findings may show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Stool cultures may show evidence of bacterial overgrowth or infection. It's also important to note that the patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and has undergone a colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis."
Congenital hypothyroidism due to developmental anomaly,"The patient, a newborn, presents with a lack of energy, difficulty feeding, constipation, and unusual sleepiness. Physical examination reveals that the infant has a larger-than-normal fontanel (soft spot on the head), a thick and protruding tongue, and a distinctive cry that is hoarse and low-pitched. The infant also has jaundice, which has lasted more than two weeks, and skin mottling. The baby's growth is slower than expected, with a shorter-than-normal length and a puffy face. The mother reports that pregnancy and delivery were uneventful, but she noticed that her baby seemed less active and more sluggish than she expected, even for a newborn. The baby's muscle tone is poor, and the infant is not meeting typical developmental milestones. Blood tests show low levels of thyroid hormone and a high level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)."
Partial chromosome Y deletion,"A new male patient presents with symptoms of infertility, including unsuccessful attempts to conceive over a year with regular unprotected intercourse. He also reports delayed or abnormal puberty, with characteristics such as decreased body hair, underdeveloped genitals, and a lack of deepening of the voice. Upon physical examination, there is clear evidence of gynecomastia, or abnormal breast tissue growth. Laboratory tests reveal low testosterone levels and increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Semen analysis may show a reduced sperm count or may even indicate azoospermia, the absence of sperm in semen. Genetic testing may be suggested to further investigate the underlying cause."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"The patient, who is a child, presents with persistent joint pain, swelling, and stiffness that seem to be worse in the morning or after periods of inactivity. These symptoms have been present for at least six weeks and are not associated with any known injuries or trauma. The patient's parents also note that the child has been experiencing intermittent fever that doesn't seem to be associated with a typical illness, such as a cold or the flu, as well as a noticeable decreased activity level. On examination, the child shows limited range of motion in affected joints and may exhibit a rash that comes and goes quickly. The patient may also show signs of growth problems, with one limb growing faster than the other. Laboratory tests show elevated inflammation markers, but no clear diagnosis has been established yet."
Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"The young patient presents with a history of persistent joint pain, which is more pronounced in the morning or after periods of inactivity. The pain is associated with swelling and stiffness, especially in the knee joints, which are asymmetrically affected. The patient also complains of intermittent low-grade fevers and fatigue. On physical examination, there is noticeable warmth, tenderness, and limited range of movements in the affected joints. There is no evidence of systemic involvement, such as rash or organomegaly. The child’s growth and development are otherwise appropriate for age. Preliminary laboratory tests show elevated inflammatory markers, but the complete blood count, renal function, and liver function tests are within normal limits. The child’s symptoms have been present for six weeks or more."
Non-syndromic posterior hypospadias,"The patient, a male infant, presents with abnormal positioning of the urethral opening, located towards the base of the penis rather than at the tip. This abnormality was noticed at birth but was not accompanied by any other congenital anomalies. The child also has a downward curvature of the penis (chordee), which was more noticeable during erection. The patient has experienced occasional difficulties with urinary stream, including spraying or dual stream, and occasional mild discomfort during urination. Despite these symptoms, the infant has a generally normal growth pattern and development, and shows no signs of hormonal, cognitive, or other systemic issues."
AIDS wasting syndrome,"The patient presents with unexplained, persistent and severe weight loss, losing more than 10% of his body weight over a short period. Along with loss of muscle mass, he reports experiencing chronic weakness and fatigue, which has significantly impaired his ability to carry out daily tasks. He has been having frequent bouts of diarrhea, which seem to persist for over a month despite treatment and is also suffering from persistent fever and night sweats. He also mentions having recurring episodes of oral thrush. Upon examination, there are signs of malnutrition and his overall appearance is emaciated. His medical history reveals no underlying conditions that could explain these symptoms. The patient also discloses that he has been sexually active with multiple partners without consistent use of protection."
Acute liver failure,"A new patient presents with general malaise, fatigue, and loss of appetite that has persisted for a few weeks. They also complain of recent onset of nausea, vomiting, and persistent discomfort in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. In addition to these symptoms, the patient has noticed a yellowish discoloration of their skin and eyes. Physical examination reveals jaundice and hepatomegaly. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, and coagulation studies reveal prolonged prothrombin time. The patient's history does not suggest any chronic liver disease, but they do admit to excessive alcohol consumption in the past."
Sarcoidosis,"The patient presents with a constellation of nonspecific symptoms that have been persistent for several weeks. They've shown signs of fatigue, slight unexplained weight loss, and intermittent fever. There's also a persistent dry cough and shortness of breath, which the patient initially attributed to a possible respiratory infection. However, these symptoms haven't resolved with over-the-counter treatments. There's also been mention of some joint pain and swelling, particularly in the ankles. Upon physical examination, there are signs of enlarged lymph nodes in the chest, detected via a chest X-ray. Skin examination revealed small red bumps on the patient's skin, particularly around the ankles and shins. The patient’s eyes also show signs of inflammation during an ophthalmologic examination."
Infant acute respiratory distress syndrome,"The infant patient initially presents with symptoms of sudden, severe difficulty in breathing characterized by rapid, shallow breaths and a noticeable flaring of the nostrils. Cyanosis, a bluish tint to the skin, lips, and fingernails, may also be evident, signifying a lack of oxygen. The child may appear fatigued or lethargic, and may also exhibit symptoms such as fever and cough. On physical examination, abnormal breath sounds such as crackles or wheezing may be heard. The child may also exhibit signs of increased work of breathing, such as retractions (visible sinking in of the chest wall during inhalation). The infant might not respond as usual, might refuse to eat, and might have difficulty maintaining a normal temperature."
Proximal spinal muscular atrophy,"The patient presents with a progressive decrease in muscle strength and tone, primarily affecting the proximal muscles, such as those closest to the center of the body. The individual may also report difficulties with tasks requiring motor skills, such as climbing stairs, lifting objects, and swallowing. In infants, there may be a noticeable lack of motor development milestones. Upon examination, the healthcare provider may observe muscle weakness and atrophy, particularly in the shoulder and hip girdle. There may also be evidence of tongue fasciculations, or involuntary muscle twitches. Despite these physical challenges, the patient's cognitive abilities and sensory perception remain unaffected."
Tenosynovial giant cell tumor,"The patient presents with a history of chronic pain and swelling, mainly localized in a joint, most likely the knee or finger. These symptoms have been progressively worsening over time and are more pronounced during movement or activity involving the affected joint. The patient may also report experiencing stiffness, decreased range of motion, and a noticeable lump or mass in the area of discomfort. On physical examination, there may be tenderness on palpation, a palpable mass, and an audible crepitus with joint movement. The joint may also exhibit signs of effusion or increased fluid build-up. Despite these symptoms, the patient's systemic health remains largely unaffected."
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency,"The patient presents with persistent shortness of breath, wheezing, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-like symptoms that do not respond to traditional asthma or COPD treatments. They may also have a history of unexplained liver disease, despite having no significant alcohol consumption history or other risk factors for liver disease. The patient may also exhibit persistent fatigue, recurring respiratory infections, and gradual unintentional weight loss. Unusual skin problems, such as panniculitis, characterized by painful, red, or swollen areas of the skin, may also be present. The patient may also have a family history of lung or liver disease. Despite being a non-smoker or having limited exposure to smoke or other lung irritants, the patient's symptoms may seem unusually severe. Lab findings may show low levels of a certain protein in the blood or abnormal liver function tests."
Myasthenia gravis,"The patient arrives with complaints of progressive fatigue and weakness, particularly noticeable in the muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, resulting in ptosis (drooping of the eyelids) and diplopia (double vision). The patient also reports difficulty in swallowing and talking, as well as shortness of breath. The weakness seems to worsen with activity and improves with rest. On further examination, the physician notes generalized muscle weakness, particularly in the facial, ocular, and proximal limb muscles. The patient's reflexes and sensory examination are normal, and there is no muscle atrophy or fasciculations. There is also an observable fluctuation in muscle weakness throughout the day, being least severe in the morning and progressively worsening as the day goes on."
Marfan syndrome,"The patient, a tall and slender individual, presents with complaints of persistent fatigue, palpitations, and episodic shortness of breath, particularly during physical activity. They also report occasional chest pain, though not severe. On examination, the patient demonstrates a greater arm span than their height, and a high-arched palate accompanied by dental crowding. They exhibit signs of scoliosis and a pectus deformity (either carinatum or excavatum). The patient also mentions recent vision changes, including increased nearsightedness and occasional visual distortions. Upon auscultation, a systolic ejection murmur is detected, indicating potential heart valve abnormalities. Their family history reveals a pattern of similar physical characteristics and cardiovascular complications."
Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency,"The patient presents with chronic diarrhea, stomach cramping, and bloating, which seem to be particularly triggered after consuming sucrose-rich foods such as fruits and sweets. Despite a normal appetite, the individual has a history of faltering weight gain and growth. A failure to thrive is noted in the patient's medical history, particularly in infancy, following the introduction of sucrose and starch into the diet. Frequent episodes of dehydration caused by diarrhea may also be reported. The patient's symptoms persist despite attempts at dietary management and exclusion of other common causes of diarrhea, such as lactose intolerance and celiac disease. Laboratory studies reveal normal results, including negative screening for celiac disease and normal stool tests, except for acidic stool pH and the presence of reducing substances."
Proximal 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome,"The patient, particularly a child, might present with developmental delays, particularly in speech and fine motor skills. They may also demonstrate behavioral issues, such as hyperactivity, attention deficits, and perhaps signs of autism spectrum disorder such as poor eye contact, difficulty with social interaction, and repetitive behaviors. Physical features might include a larger than average head circumference (macrocephaly), and possibly some minor distinctive facial features such as widely spaced eyes or low-set ears, although these are not universally present. The patient might also have a history of seizures or epilepsy, and less commonly, heart or kidney abnormalities. Parents might express concern about their child's learning difficulties or unusual behaviors."
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy,"The patient presents with symptoms of palpitations, lightheadedness, and sudden episodes of fainting, particularly during or after physical activity. They also report episodes of shortness of breath and occasional chest pain. Their family history reveals instances of sudden cardiac death at a young age. Upon clinical examination, ECG may show T-wave inversions in right precordial leads, ventricular tachycardia of left bundle branch block morphology, or ventricular arrhythmias. Echocardiogram may indicate right ventricular dilatation, dyskinesia or regional hypokinesia. However, these tests may also appear normal, making the condition challenging to diagnose at this stage."
Limbal stem cell deficiency,"The patient presents with a series of ocular discomforts that predominantly include persistent irritation, redness, and sensitivity to light. They also report blurred vision and frequent bouts of ocular pain, despite having no history of eye trauma or surgery. Upon examination, the patient's cornea appears irregular with thickened epithelium and exhibits recurrent erosions. Notably, there is a visible lack of limbal palisades of Vogt, and a progressive conjunctivalization of the cornea is noted. Despite the use of artificial tears and lubricants, the symptoms persist and continue to worsen over time."
Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia,"A female patient may present to primary care with complaints of persistent vulvar discomfort, including symptoms such as itching, burning, or tenderness in the vulvar area. She may also report changes in the color of the vulvar skin or the presence of a visible lesion. Upon examination, the healthcare provider may notice vulvar skin abnormalities such as raised, red, white, or dark-colored patches, ulcers, or wart-like growths. The patient might also have a history of irregular Pap smear results, persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, or previous lower genital tract neoplasias. Despite these complaints and findings, no clear diagnosis has been made at the time of arrival."
Complete atrioventricular septal defect,"A new patient arrives at the clinic presenting with symptoms including shortness of breath, especially during physical activity, and feeling tired or fatigued easily. The patient also reports frequent respiratory infections and having a bluish color to the skin, lips, and fingernails, especially during physical activity. Additionally, upon physical examination, the doctor notes an abnormal heart sound (heart murmur) when listening to the patient's heart with a stethoscope. The patient also exhibits slow growth and weight gain compared to others of the same age."
Brugada syndrome,"The patient presents with recurrent episodes of fainting (syncope), dizziness, palpitations, or shortness of breath indicating a potential cardiac issue. These symptoms are often more noticeable during rest or sleep. They might also have a history of sudden cardiac arrest or sudden death in their family, particularly in relatively young individuals. On examination, an electrocardiogram (ECG) shows distinctive patterns such as ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1-V3) and right bundle branch block, which are indicative of abnormal electrical activity in the heart. However, these ECG changes may not be always present and can sometimes be unmasked by a sodium channel blocker test. Despite these concerning symptoms and findings, the patient appears generally healthy with no structural heart abnormalities detected on echocardiogram."
Cystic fibrosis,"The patient presents with persistent, recurrent respiratory infections, often characterized by a chronic cough that produces thick, sticky mucus, and a history of sinusitis. They also report frequent bouts of bronchitis or pneumonia. Additionally, the individual may complain of persistent gastrointestinal issues, including greasy or bulky stools, severe constipation, and unexplained weight loss or failure to gain weight despite a normal diet, potentially indicating issues with nutrient absorption. The patient may also show symptoms of malnutrition, such as slow growth and development in children, and a deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins. Other symptoms might include salty-tasting skin, and in males, potential fertility issues."
Isolated spina bifida,"The patient presents with a variety of non-specific symptoms including frequent urinary tract infections, bowel incontinence, and weakness in the lower extremities. Physical examination reveals a dimple or abnormal patch of hair on the lower back, along with lower limb asymmetry and a degree of muscle wastage. The patient also reports lower back pain and has difficulty walking, with a tendency to trip or fall. Notably, the patient's symptoms seem to have been present since birth, but have gradually worsened over time. Despite these symptoms, there are no apparent cognitive or intellectual impairments, and the patient's upper body strength and coordination appear unaffected."
Isolated biliary atresia,"A new patient, an infant, presents with persistent jaundice beyond the neonatal period, which is not improving even after two weeks of life. The parents have noted that the child's stools are unusually pale or clay-colored and the urine is dark. The infant has not been gaining weight optimally and seems irritable. Upon physical examination, the health care provider notes an enlarged liver and spleen. The child's blood tests indicate abnormally high levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes, and the ultrasound suggests abnormality in the biliary system."
Anal fistula,"The patient presents with persistent discomfort and pain around the anal area, describing a throbbing sensation that is particularly bothersome during bowel movements. They report intermittent episodes of anal discharge that sometimes contains blood or pus, leading to occasional staining of their underwear. The patient also mentions recurrent anal abscesses that seem to heal but then reappear. Upon physical examination, there are signs of redness and swelling around the anal area, and there might be one or more openings near the anus from which pus might be draining. The patient also has a low-grade fever which they attributed to fatigue and stress. Despite the use of over-the-counter medications for hemorrhoids, the symptoms have not only persisted but seem to have worsened.
"
Adenovirus infection in immunocompromised patients,"The patient, with an underlying condition that weakens the immune system, presents with acute, non-specific symptoms including high fever, sore throat, persistent cough, and malaise. The patient may also complain of conjunctivitis, which is characterized by redness, swelling, and a gritty sensation in the eyes. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort may also be observed. In severe cases, the patient may experience difficulty in breathing and chest pain. Lab tests may reveal an increase in white blood cell count, indicating an active infection. Furthermore, a chest X-ray could show signs of pneumonia. Despite these symptoms, initial tests for common respiratory infections may turn out negative."
Non-infectious posterior uveitis,"The patient presents with a history of recurring episodes of blurry vision and eye pain, more pronounced in one eye. The patient also reports seeing floaters, often described as small moving spots in their field of vision. A worsening of symptoms during evenings and nights is noted. On examination, there's an observable inflammation in the back part of the eye, specifically involving the choroid and retina. Fundoscopic evaluation reveals vitreous haze and retinal vasculitis. The patient also has a history of autoimmune disorders, but no recent signs of infectious disease or trauma. Despite the recurrent nature of symptoms, the patient shows no signs of vision loss during symptom-free periods."
Pemphigus vulgaris,"The patient presents with persistent and progressive oral ulcers that are painful, making it difficult to eat or drink. The ulcers are often preceded by small vesicles or blisters that quickly rupture, leaving behind raw, sensitive areas. In addition, the patient might also mention sporadic skin lesions, which initially appear as flaccid blisters on otherwise healthy-looking skin that break open easily. The skin and mucous membrane lesions do not appear to heal, or heal very slowly and tend to recur. The patient may also exhibit nonspecific symptoms such as weight loss and malaise. Despite the use of over-the-counter ointments and mouthwashes, there has been no improvement. Physical examination reveals erosions and crusts on the skin and oral mucosa, with a positive Nikolsky sign (gentle lateral pressure on the skin results in exfoliation of the outermost layer)."
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,"The patient, a newborn, presents with severe lethargy, difficulty feeding, and rapid breathing. Upon physical examination, noticeable cyanosis (bluish coloration of the skin) is observed, particularly around the lips and under the fingernails. The infant's pulses are weaker than normal and there is a distinct murmur on auscultation of the heart. Additionally, the patient's liver is mildly enlarged. Blood tests reveal decreased oxygen level and an echocardiogram shows certain abnormalities including a small left ventricle, aorta, and other related structures, along with abnormal blood flow patterns."
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1,"A new patient arrives at the primary care clinic reporting progressive muscle weakness and wasting, predominantly in the lower legs and feet, leading to foot deformities such as high arches and hammer toes. They also complain about loss of sensation in their feet and hands, which they describe as a constant numbness or tingling. They have a history of tripping or difficulty with balance and coordination, and have noticed a decrease in their ability to run or walk long distances. On examination, the patient exhibits decreased deep tendon reflexes, particularly in the ankles. They also have muscle weakness in their hands, leading to difficulty with tasks that require fine motor skills. The patient's family history may also reveal similar symptoms among relatives, suggesting a possible hereditary component."
Familial isolated dilated cardiomyopathy,"The patient presents with complaints of persistent fatigue, shortness of breath, particularly during physical exertion, and occasional heart palpitations. They also report unexplained weight gain and swelling in the lower extremities, particularly towards the end of the day. On examination, there are findings of a third heart sound (S3 gallop) and signs of fluid overload such as jugular venous distension and peripheral edema. The patient also has a family history of heart failure and sudden cardiac death at relatively young ages. These symptoms and findings raise concerns about a potential underlying cardiac disorder with a possible genetic component."
Gastroschisis,"The patient, a newborn infant, is brought to care with notable findings of a visible opening on the right side of the umbilical cord through which the intestine is protruding. The intestines, which are uncovered by a protective sac, appear swollen, inflamed and possibly twisted. The baby may be smaller than expected for gestational age or could be suffering from intrauterine growth restriction. Parents may report feeding difficulties, including vomiting, along with failure to gain weight or grow at the expected rate. There may also be signs of distress or discomfort, such as excessive crying, restlessness, or a general lack of response to stimuli. The patient may also exhibit complications such as respiratory problems, infection, or dehydration due to excessive fluid loss from the exposed intestines."
Trisomy 18,"The patient, a young infant, presents with a series of physical abnormalities and developmental delays. Notably, the infant demonstrates severe growth deficiency and is significantly smaller than expected for their age. Facial features are distinct, including a small jaw, low-set ears, and eyes that exhibit a severe upward slant. There are also noticeable structural anomalies in their hands, such as clenched fists with overlapping fingers. The child has difficulty feeding and shows signs of intellectual disability, reflected in slow motor development and poor responsiveness to stimuli. Cardiac examination reveals possible congenital heart defects. Additionally, the infant experiences frequent respiratory infections, a sign of potentially compromised immune function."
Recessive X-linked ichthyosis,"A male patient might present with chronic, widespread dry skin that appears rough and scaly, often described as ""fish-like"". He may report the condition has been present since infancy or early childhood, with symptoms often worsening during winter months due to drier conditions. On physical examination, large, dark scales particularly on the extensor surfaces such as the elbows and knees can be observed, with sparing of the face, hands, and feet. He may also have corneal opacities or undescended testes, and a family history might reveal that his mother and sisters have been carriers but remain asymptomatic."
Acute peripheral arterial occlusion,"The patient presents with sudden onset of severe pain in one of their limbs, most commonly the leg, that is not relieved by rest and seems out of proportion to the physical examination. The pain is often described as aching, cramping, or burning and may be associated with numbness or weakness. The affected limb may feel cold to touch and appear pale or bluish in color. The patient may also report a decrease or absence of pulse in the affected limb. Upon examination, the physician might find that the limb is indeed cold, and there may be a decrease or absence of sensation. The patient may have a history of smoking, diabetes, or other risk factors for vascular disease."
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia,"The patient presents with recurrent nosebleeds, a symptom they've experienced since childhood, along with noticeable red or dark spots on their skin, particularly on their face and hands. They also report having blood in their stool and unexplained fatigue. The patient's family history reveals that several members have had similar symptoms or had suffered from gastrointestinal bleeding or stroke at a relatively young age. Upon physical examination, telangiectasias - small, visible blood vessels on the skin surface - are observed. Additionally, they also exhibit signs of mild anemia. Further tests might be ordered based on these initial observations and complaints, including a complete blood count (CBC), liver function test and imaging studies."
Primary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,"A new patient may present with symptoms such as fatigue, loss of appetite, and generalized swelling, particularly in the legs and around the eyes. Upon examination, there might be signs of high blood pressure and decreased urine output. Urinalysis could reveal proteinuria and hematuria, indicating possible kidney damage. In some cases, the patient might also exhibit symptoms of nephrotic syndrome including severe proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Blood tests might show elevated levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen, indicative of reduced kidney function. In more advanced stages, there could also be indications of anemia or other blood abnormalities. Such a constellation of symptoms and findings could suggest a primary disorder affecting the glomeruli of the kidneys."
Buerger disease,"The patient arrives complaining of recurring pain in their hands and feet, which they've noticed tends to flare up during periods of exertion or stress. They have also been experiencing unusual coldness in their fingers and toes, as well as noticeable changes in their skin color, alternating between pale and bluish tones. They have reported the development of open sores on their fingers and toes, which are taking a long time to heal. The patient also has a history of heavy smoking. On examination, the patient's pulse in the affected limbs is weak or absent, and there are signs of inflammation along the veins. The patient's blood work is normal, and there is no evidence of other systemic diseases."
Tuberculosis,"The patient presents with a persistent cough, lasting for more than three weeks, that may produce blood-tinged sputum. Accompanying symptoms include fatigue, unexplained weight loss, poor appetite, fever, night sweats, and chills. The individual may have a history of exposure to someone with a chronic cough, or recent travel to a region with high rates of a particular infectious disease. On examination, there may be signs of mild respiratory distress such as shortness of breath. The patient's general condition may appear unwell, with potential signs of malnutrition or wasting. Further diagnostic tests would be recommended to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms."
Herpes simplex virus stromal keratitis,"The patient presents with complaints of recurring bouts of redness and discomfort in one eye, sometimes accompanied by blurred vision and sensitivity to light. Notably, there is a history of similar, less severe episodes in the past. Upon examination, there is evidence of inflammation in the cornea with localized areas of clouding, suggestive of scarring from previous episodes. Small blisters or ulcers might be present on the eyelid or conjunctiva. Visual acuity is reduced in the affected eye, and there may be mild swelling and tenderness of the nearby lymph nodes. The patient may also report occasional cold sores around the mouth or facial area."
Microtia,"The patient, a young child, presents with noticeable asymmetry of the ears, with one appearing smaller and underdeveloped compared to the other. The parents have reported recurrent ear infections and hearing difficulties on the affected side, which have impacted the child's speech and language development. The child has experienced difficulties with balance, leading to occasional falls. The physical examination reveals an abnormally shaped external ear, with an underdeveloped or missing ear canal, and possible abnormalities in the middle ear. Tests indicate a conductive hearing loss on the affected side."
Rare carcinoma of pancreas,"The patient presents with nonspecific complaints such as unexplained weight loss, persistent generalized weakness, and loss of appetite. They also report a recent onset of mild to moderate upper abdominal pain that sometimes radiates to the back, accompanied by bouts of nausea and vomiting. Notably, the patient has developed a new-onset of jaundice, with yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark urine, and light-colored stools. They also mention a sudden onset of diabetes or worsening of pre-existing diabetes symptoms. There may also be evidence of deep vein thrombosis or migratory thrombophlebitis, characterized by swelling, redness, and tenderness along a vein. Upon examination, the patient may show signs of hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) or palpable gallbladder."

The patient's symptoms seem to be progressively worsening, affecting their daily activities."
Hepatocellular carcinoma,"The patient presents with persistent, vague abdominal discomfort, especially in the upper right quadrant, and unexplained weight loss. There is also a noticeable loss of appetite and feelings of fullness after a small meal. The patient reports feelings of fatigue and weakness, which is unusual given their previous activity levels. Furthermore, there is a yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice), a change in stool color to a pale or chalky shade, and darkening of urine. Physical examination reveals an enlarged, tender liver and ascites, which is an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen. Laboratory tests show elevated liver enzymes and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, suggesting possible liver dysfunction."
Mucopolysaccharidosis type 4A,"The patient presents with a variety of nonspecific symptoms that include frequent respiratory infections, difficulty in breathing, hearing loss, and corneal clouding resulting in impaired vision. They also show evidence of musculoskeletal abnormalities such as kyphoscoliosis, joint stiffness, and short stature. Further examination also reveals facial dysmorphism, with coarse facial features. The patient's parents report developmental delay in the child, particularly in their motor skills and there is also a history of cardiac problems. The patient's symptoms have been progressive and chronic, with a gradual onset over the course of their life. Despite undergoing a variety of tests, no definitive diagnosis has been made yet."
Young-onset Parkinson disease,"The patient, a relatively young adult, presents with persistent, subtle, and unexplained motor symptoms such as tremors in one hand, stiffness or slowing of movement, and issues with balance. Non-motor symptoms might include changes in mood such as depression or anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, or loss of sense of smell. The patient may also report micrographia (small, cramped handwriting), voice changes, or a masked facial expression. These symptoms have been gradually worsening over time and are not associated with any recent injury or other obvious cause. The patient may also note a family history of similar symptoms, suggesting a possible genetic component. Despite these complaints, general physical and neurological examinations may not reveal any clear abnormalities."
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,"The patient, a child aged between 3 to 5 years old, presents with a recent history of multiple types of seizures that are difficult to control, with atonic seizures (also known as drop attacks) being particularly frequent. The parents also report a notable decline in the child's cognition and social behavior. The child's physical examination reveals signs of slow psychomotor development, and their EEG shows a characteristic pattern of slow spike-wave complexes. Despite being on multiple antiepileptic drugs, the child's seizures are poorly controlled. There is no known family history of epilepsy, and the onset of these symptoms is unexplained."
Familial cerebral cavernous malformation,"The patient presents with a range of neurological symptoms that have progressively worsened over time. They report a history of recurrent headaches, unexplained episodes of dizziness, and occasional difficulty with coordination or balance. They also describe occasional visual disturbances and periods of confusion or memory loss. Physical examination reveals subtle neurological deficits, such as mild weakness on one side of the body and slightly impaired fine motor skills. The patient also has a family history of similar symptoms, including some relatives who experienced seizures or strokes at a young age. These symptoms and findings are suggestive of a progressive neurological condition with a genetic component."
Atopic keratoconjunctivitis,"The patient may report persistent itching, redness, burning sensation, and watering in the eyes that has been recurring for a while. They may also complain of sensitivity to light, blurred vision, and a feeling of something foreign in the eyes. On examination, there may be visible inflammation of the conjunctiva and the cornea, with thickening or roughening of the inner eyelid. The patient may also have a history of allergies or other atopic diseases like asthma or eczema. Additionally, there might be presence of a stringy, white mucus discharge, and papillae (small, round, bumpy structures) or small blisters on the inside of the upper eyelid. The presence of corneal erosions or ulcers might indicate a more progressive case."
Dentinogenesis imperfecta type 2,"The patient presents with a history of multiple dental issues, such as frequent cavities, chipped and broken teeth, and discolored teeth that are blue-gray or yellow-brown. Despite good oral hygiene practices, these problems persist. The patient also reports that their teeth are translucent or opalescent and that they have experienced dental sensitivity. Upon examination, the patient's teeth may exhibit wear and breakage atypical for their age. The enamel may appear normal but separates easily from the underlying dentin. The patient may also have issues with their bite, such as an open or deep bite due to abnormal tooth and jaw development. Radiographic findings may include bulbous crowns, cervical constriction, pulpal obliteration, and root abnormalities."
Dentinogenesis imperfecta,"The patient, unaware of any specific diagnosis, presents with a history of frequent dental issues including tooth breakage, cavities and sensitivity. They report that their teeth seem to be discoloured, with a yellowish or brownish hue, and have a translucent or opalescent appearance. They also note that their teeth seem to be wearing down more quickly than expected, despite maintaining good oral hygiene practices. They may also mention that they've had frequent dental abscesses, despite not having typical causes like untreated cavities. The patient might additionally report a family history of similar dental problems, suggesting a possible hereditary component."
Thyroid ectopia,"The patient, without any clear diagnosis, presents with chief complaints of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Upon physical examination, the patient exhibits a noticeable absence of the thyroid gland in its normal location in the neck. Laboratory tests reveal elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with low levels of thyroxine (T4), indicative of hypothyroidism. Furthermore, during imaging studies, an abnormal thyroid tissue location is seen, possibly in the base of the tongue or mediastinum. The patient may also demonstrate difficulties in swallowing or breathing due to the misplaced glandular tissue."
Progressive supranuclear palsy,"A new patient presents to primary care with complaints of unexplained falls, typically backwards, over the past few months. The patient also reports difficulty with eye movements, particularly when trying to look downwards. The balance problems are associated with stiffness and awkward movements. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing changes in behavior including apathy, depression, irritability, and mild forgetfulness. There are also complaints of difficulties in swallowing, slurred speech, and in some instances, double vision. Upon examination, the patient demonstrates slow movements, a lack of facial expression, and a decreased blink rate, giving a ""fixed"" stare. Despite these symptoms, the patient's intellect and memory remain relatively intact."
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,"The patient presents with persistent headaches that she describes as dull and throbbing, which significantly worsen when she wakes up in the morning or changes posture. She also reports occasional episodes of transient visual disturbances, such as short episodes of blurred or double vision. On some occasions, she has also experienced a whooshing sound in her ears that coincides with her heartbeat. Additionally, she complains of neck, back or shoulder pain, and occasionally feels dizzy or nauseous. Upon physical examination, there is evidence of papilledema, or swelling of the optic nerve, seen during fundoscopic examination. Her neurological examination is otherwise normal. Despite these symptoms, imaging tests like CT or MRI show no abnormalities in the brain structure."
Cystinuria,"The patient presents with recurrent episodes of severe pain in the lower back or sides (flank pain), which may radiate to the lower abdomen or groin. They also report frequent urination, blood in urine, and difficulty passing urine. Physical examination may not reveal notable abnormalities, but urinalysis shows increased levels of certain amino acids, particularly cystine. The patient's medical history reveals no significant illnesses but includes a family history of similar symptoms and kidney stones. Despite maintaining adequate hydration, the patient continues to produce unusually hard, crystalline stones in the urine."
Chronic primary adrenal insufficiency,"The patient presents with persistent fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, and unexplained weight loss for several weeks. There are also complaints of gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient also reports increased craving for salt and dizziness upon standing up. The skin appears hyperpigmented, especially in areas that are not exposed to the sun such as creases in the skin, gums, and knuckles. Blood pressure is low, further decreasing when the patient stands up from a lying position. Initial blood tests display low sodium levels, high potassium levels, and low cortisol levels."
Holoprosencephaly,"The patient presents with a range of developmental delays and facial abnormalities. These include microcephaly (small head size), closely spaced eyes, a small nose with a single nostril, a cleft lip/palate, and abnormal development of the forebrain. Neurologically, the patient exhibits seizures, feeding difficulties, impaired cognitive development, and issues with motor coordination. These symptoms are complemented by endocrine problems such as diabetes insipidus, growth hormone deficiency, and hypogonadism. Furthermore, the patient has a history of repeated respiratory infections, which suggests an impaired immune response. Despite these symptoms, standard genetic testing has not identified a clear diagnosis."
Supravalvular aortic stenosis,"The patient presents with unexplained persistent fatigue and shortness of breath, particularly during exercise or any physical exertion. They report occasional chest pain and dizziness, sometimes coupled with fainting spells. On examination, a heart murmur is detected. The patient's family history reveals instances of heart disease and genetic disorders. Cardiac imaging shows a narrowing just above the aortic valve in the heart, causing an obstruction in blood flow from the heart to the aorta, and an increased left ventricular wall thickness."
Hirschsprung disease,"The patient, an infant, presents with a history of persistent constipation since birth, often failing to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life. The child's growth and development seem to be lagging, possibly due to malnutrition. Upon examination, the abdomen appears distended and palpation reveals a lack of bowel sounds. There is a noted failure to thrive and the infant shows signs of discomfort when attempting bowel movements, often straining without success. The child's mother reports periods of diarrhea between episodes of constipation, which she initially interpreted as a sign of improvement. The patient also presents with features of enterocolitis such as fever, vomiting and explosive stools."
Stargardt disease,"The patient, who is in their early teens, presents with chief complaints of difficulty reading and seeing in dim lighting, a decrease in their color perception, and blurriness or blind spots in the center of their vision. They also mention that they've noticed a gradual decline in their vision over the past few months. Upon examination, the physician notes a reduction in visual acuity and subtle changes in the patient's retina, including yellow-white flecks scattered in the retinal pigment epithelium layer at the posterior pole. The physician might also identify a decrease in central vision when conducting a visual field test. Despite these findings, the patient's peripheral vision seems to be relatively unaffected."
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,"The patient, a prematurely born infant, presents with persistent symptoms of respiratory distress including increased work of breathing, rapid breathing, and a chronic cough. The infant may also exhibit poor weight gain and growth, as well as frequent respiratory infections. Physical examination shows signs of undernutrition, decreased breath sounds, and possible cyanosis. The patient’s history reveals the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy after birth. Additionally, imaging studies might show lung abnormalities such as hyperinflation, thickened septa, and cystic changes. The patient's oxygen saturation levels may be lower than expected, indicating difficulty in breathing and oxygenation."
Pleural empyema,"The patient presents with persistent and severe chest pain that is exacerbated while breathing or coughing. They also express a recent history of high-grade fever, chills, and night sweats. The individual reports progressive shortness of breath and a persistent, productive cough that may yield yellow or green phlegm. They also voice unexplained weight loss and general fatigue. On examination, the physician may note decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, and possibly pleural friction rub on the affected side of the patient's chest. There may also be indications of a previous or ongoing respiratory infection, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. Furthermore, the patient shows signs of systemic inflammation, such as elevated white blood cell counts, in their routine blood investigations."
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor,"The patient presents with nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal discomfort or pain, feeling of fullness, and early satiety. There might also be non-specific symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss. On physical examination, an abdominal mass might be palpable, but it's not always the case. If the tumor is located near the stomach or esophagus, the patient might complain of difficulty swallowing. In some cases, the patient may report gastrointestinal bleeding, which can manifest as black, tarry stools (melena), or blood in the stool (hematochezia), or even anemia. However, it's important to note that these symptoms are quite common and can be seen in many other gastrointestinal conditions, thus further diagnostic tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis."
Mucolipidosis type III alpha/beta,"The patient, a child or adolescent, presents with a history of frequent respiratory infections, complaints of joint stiffness and discomfort, specifically in the hips, and some difficulty with mobility. Notably, the patient may also report growth delay in comparison to peers. On physical examination, mild to moderate facial coarsening, such as a mildly enlarged tongue or nose, is noted. Skeletal abnormalities such as claw hand deformity, hip dysplasia, and kyphosis are observed. The patient also presents with mild cognitive impairment and difficulty in school performance, particularly in subjects requiring abstract thought and problem-solving skills. Further investigation may reveal heart valve abnormalities and the presence of cloudiness in the cornea."
Thyroid carcinoma,"The patient could present with a number of non-specific symptoms, such as a painless lump or swelling in the neck, hoarseness or changes in voice, difficulty swallowing, and possibly trouble breathing. The patient might also have persistent cough that is not associated with a cold. There might be swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Some individuals might also experience unexplained weight loss or fatigue. Upon physical examination, a hard nodule may be palpated in the thyroid area of the neck. The patient might not experience any significant discomfort, and the symptoms could easily be mistaken for other, less serious conditions, thereby making early detection somewhat challenging."
Triploidy,"The patient presents with a variety of symptoms that include significant growth delay and intellectual disabilities. Physical examination reveals distinct facial features such as a small head (microcephaly), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), an abnormal groove in the upper lip (cleft lip) and a downturned mouth with a thin upper lip. The patient also exhibits unusual skin pigmentation, with areas of lighter or darker skin. Musculoskeletal abnormalities are evident, including extra fingers or toes (polydactyly) and a condition where the long bones in the arms and legs are shorter than normal (mesomelia). Notably, the patient also has heart defects and genitourinary anomalies, such as undescended testes in males or malformed uterus in females. There is also a history of neonatal complications, such as low birth weight and difficulty feeding."
Von Willebrand disease,"The patient presents with recurrent and prolonged nosebleeds, gum bleeding, and unusually heavy or extended menstrual flow. They also report easy bruising and excessive bleeding following minor injuries, dental procedures, or surgeries. Lab results reveal prolonged bleeding times and decreased levels of a specific clotting protein, despite normal platelet counts. Additionally, there is a family history of similar bleeding disorders, suggesting a possible genetic component to the symptoms."
Addison disease,"The patient presents with a range of nonspecific symptoms including fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, and unexplained weight loss. They may also report bouts of low blood pressure, leading to dizziness or fainting, and a craving for salty foods due to salt loss. The individual may exhibit hyperpigmentation, with unusually dark or tanned skin, even in areas not exposed to the sun. They may also have low blood sugar and gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Blood tests may show elevated potassium levels and low sodium levels. If stress, such as an illness or surgery, triggers more severe symptoms, they may experience sudden penetrating pain in the lower back, abdomen, or legs, severe vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, and loss of consciousness."
Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"A new patient arrives at primary care presenting with a range of non-specific symptoms, including frequent joint dislocations or subluxations, widespread musculoskeletal pain, and chronic fatigue. They may also exhibit unusually elastic or velvety skin, which bruises easily and heals poorly, alongside atrophic scarring. The patient reports a history of sprains, strains, and other joint or ligament injuries, even from minimal trauma. They may also report a history of gastrointestinal issues, such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or cardiovascular problems like orthostatic hypotension. The patient might also show signs of anxiety or panic disorders. Upon physical examination, evidence of joint hypermobility may be found, which can be assessed using the Beighton Score."
Steinert myotonic dystrophy,"A new patient arrives in primary care presenting with a combination of symptoms that includes progressive muscle weakness and wasting, especially in the face, jaw, and neck. They report having difficulties swallowing and facial weakness, which has led to changes in their facial appearance. They also mention experiencing myotonia, which is a delay in the relaxation of their muscles after contracting. The patient has been feeling excessively sleepy during the day and has had episodes of sudden sleep. They also report having frequent headaches, as well as problems with focus and memory. Additionally, they mention experiencing a decrease in their sex drive and difficulties with sexual performance. Upon physical examination, the patient shows a balding pattern on the front of the scalp, droopy eyelids, and a thin, long face with hollow cheeks. The patient's medical history reveals that these symptoms have been progressing slowly over a period of time."
Rare lymphatic malformation,"The patient presents with non-specific symptoms that include a noticeable lump or swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin area, which may or may not be painful. There may also be a history of recurrent infections in the affected area. The swelling may fluctuate in size and could become more noticeable following an upper respiratory infection. Secondary symptoms may include difficulty breathing, eating, or speaking, depending on the location of the swelling. Physical examination may reveal a soft, easily compressible, non-tender mass that transilluminates. The patient may also have blue-tinged skin overlying the mass, or a cluster of small veins visible near the surface of the skin in the affected area. This is often associated with fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and night sweats. Imaging studies may show cystic lesions of varying size within soft tissue structures."
Stickler syndrome,"The patient presents with a variety of symptoms that collectively suggest a connective tissue disorder. Primary complaints include severe nearsightedness (myopia) from an early age, joint stiffness and pain, and hearing loss that cannot be attributed to age or exposure. Upon physical examination, the patient displays unique facial characteristics such as a flat midface, depressed nasal bridge, and small jaw. Eye examination reveals a detached retina and cataracts, while audiological testing shows sensorineural hearing loss. A comprehensive review of the patient's family history indicates a pattern of similar symptoms, suggesting a potential genetic component to the condition."
CD4+/CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm,"A new patient coming to primary care could present with complaints of persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, fever, and night sweats, which are common symptoms associated with systemic diseases. Upon cutaneous examination, the patient may exhibit skin lesions that range from erythematous patches to nodules or tumors primarily on the face, upper trunk, and limbs. The patient may also have an enlarged spleen or liver felt upon palpation, and lymphadenopathy could be noted. Laboratory findings could reveal abnormalities in complete blood count, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukocytosis. Further tests may show abnormal cells in the blood, bone marrow, or skin biopsy."
Small cell lung cancer,"The patient reports a persistent cough, unexplained weight loss, and shortness of breath, especially upon physical exertion. He also mentions bouts of chest pain and recurrent respiratory infections. Despite being a non-smoker, he has been exposed to secondhand smoke and asbestos at his workplace. Upon physical examination, there is wheezing and decreased breath sounds. Lab results indicate hypercalcemia and an elevated level of a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). A chest X-ray reveals a mass in one of the lungs, and further imaging tests show abnormalities in the lymph nodes. Cytological examination of the sputum sample identifies atypical cells."
Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency,"The patient, a young child, presents with recurrent episodes of lethargy, vomiting, and hypoglycemia, particularly following periods of fasting or illness. The parent reports that these episodes are often preceded by poor appetite and fatigue. Physical examination reveals hepatomegaly and mild muscle weakness. Laboratory tests indicate metabolic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal urine organic acid profile, particularly during episodes of illness or stress. Notably, the child appears well between episodes, with no chronic symptoms or developmental delays. The child's growth and development are otherwise normal, but these recurrent episodes are concerning for a possible metabolic disorder."
Huntington disease,"The patient presents with subtle cognitive changes, such as difficulty focusing, forgetfulness, and slight personality changes, which they attribute to stress or aging. They report experiencing involuntary jerky movements, particularly in the hands, and some issues with coordination, like stumbling or clumsiness. The patient may also complain of mood swings, bouts of depression or irritability, and difficulty sleeping. On physical examination, there may be evidence of chorea, or irregular, uncontrollable movements. Cognitive tests could reveal mild impairment in executive function. While the patient's symptoms are not debilitating, they are noticeable and gradually worsening over time."
Multiple myeloma,"The patient presents with a constellation of vague symptoms including persistent fatigue, recurrent infections, and unexplained weight loss. They also report occasional bone pain, particularly in their back and ribs, which is often worse at night or when active. The patient has also been experiencing bouts of constipation and frequent urination. Blood tests reveal anemia and elevated levels of calcium, while a urine test shows high levels of protein. On further examination, the patient also seems to have mild nerve damage, as evidenced by weakness and numbness in their legs."
Omphalocele,"The parents of a newborn bring their infant to primary care for the first time, expressing concerns about a noticeable protrusion at the infant's umbilical site. The protrusion appears to contain abdominal organs and is covered by a thin, translucent sac. The infant has no apparent discomfort, but the parents report difficulties with feeding, including poor suck, slow feeding, and some vomiting. The infant appears small for their age and has a weak cry. The parents also mention a history of polyhydramnios during pregnancy. Physical examination confirms these findings, with additional notes of potential developmental delays or abnormalities."
"Focal, segmental or multifocal dystonia","The patient would likely present with complaints of involuntary muscle contractions, resulting in abnormal movements or postures in specific parts of the body. These could include twisting, repetitive movements, or even painful cramps. The symptoms might initially be induced by specific actions or during specific tasks and may progress to occur more generally. The severity could fluctify throughout the day, and may worsen with stress or fatigue. The patient might also report that the symptoms are reduced during sleep or when distracted. Physical examination could reveal sustained muscle contractions causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures, often asymmetrical, and affecting a single body region or multiple non-contiguous body regions. The patient might also exhibit a 'geste antagoniste' or 'sensory trick' — a physical gesture, such as touching the chin, that temporarily reduces the severity of the dystonic postures or movements."
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"The patient presents with a persistent dry cough and a recent history of gradual, unexplained shortness of breath, particularly during exercise. The individual may report feeling unusually tired and may have experienced unexplained weight loss. In addition, on physical examination, the healthcare provider may notice the presence of fine crackles on auscultation of the lungs, which is often described as the sound of Velcro being pulled apart. A clubbing of the fingers and toes could also be observed, which refers to the broadening and rounding of the fingertips or toe tips."
Systemic mastocytosis,"The patient presents with a variety of nonspecific symptoms including episodes of flushing, unexplained rashes, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. They have noted that their symptoms seem to intensify in response to certain triggers such as heat or stress. They may also report occasional headaches, lightheadedness, palpitations, and irritability. Notably, they might experience episodes of unexplained anaphylaxis. Physical examination may reveal dermatographism, a condition where the skin becomes raised and inflamed when scratched. Lab tests might indicate elevated tryptase levels. Additionally, they may have a history of bone pain and fractures that cannot be fully explained by any other condition.
"
Hemophilia A,"The patient, a young male, arrives at the clinic presenting with unexplained and prolonged bleeding even from minor injuries or surgical procedures, large painful bruises, spontaneous bleeding into joints and muscles causing swelling, redness and pain, and frequent nosebleeds. He may also report persistent blood in his urine or stool. Upon physical examination, the physician may note an elevated heart rate suggesting blood loss, joint deformities due to recurrent bleeding into the joints, and a lack of any apparent external injuries that could explain the severity of the bleeding. Laboratory tests may reveal a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) which indicates a delay in blood clotting, while other blood clotting tests may be normal."
Neuroblastoma,"The patient, a young child, presents with non-specific symptoms including persistent fatigue, loss of appetite, and unexplained weight loss. The parents also report intermittent episodes of fever with no clear source of infection. The child has been experiencing abdominal pain, which upon physical examination could correspond to a palpable mass in the abdominal area. Additional symptoms have included changes in bowel habits and persistent limping without history of injury. The child also seems to have developed drooping eyelids and unequal pupil sizes, coupled with complaints about blurred or double vision. It's also worth noting that the parents have observed occasional episodes of high blood pressure. Despite these symptoms, lab tests and imaging have not yet indicated a clear diagnosis."
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"The patient presents with a range of non-specific symptoms including persistent fatigue, frequent bouts of fever and infections, unexplained weight loss, and generalized body weakness. They also report episodes of spontaneous bleeding or bruising, accompanied by petechiae (pinpoint red spots on the skin). Upon physical examination, the patient has pallor and appears generally unwell. There is noticeable lymphadenopathy, particularly in the neck and armpit regions, and the spleen appears enlarged on palpation. In addition, the patient also complains of bone pain, especially in the legs and sternum. Blood tests reveal anemia and an abnormal increase in white blood cells, with a high proportion of immature cells, and reduced platelet count."
Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome,"A teenage girl presents in primary care with a chief complaint of primary amenorrhea despite normal development of secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development and pubic hair. She also reports experiencing cyclic abdominal pain that she associates with menstruation, but without any bleeding. On physical examination, the clinician finds a normal external genitalia but an unusually shallow or absent vagina. The patient also mentions that she has never been sexually active due to discomfort during attempted intercourse. Further imaging investigations may reveal an underdeveloped or absent uterus and cervix, but normal ovaries and kidney anomalies. The patient also reports feelings of anxiety and distress related to her symptoms."
Williams syndrome,"The patient, a young child, presents with distinct craniofacial features including a broad forehead, periorbital fullness, a small upturned nose, and a wide mouth with full lips. They exhibit developmental delays, particularly in gross motor skills, and mild to moderate intellectual disability, but they also have surprisingly strong verbal abilities and an extremely friendly, social personality, often engaging with strangers. Heart murmurs were detected, indicative of possible cardiovascular issues. Their parents report the child has high calcium levels in their blood, which they discovered after the child showed signs of irritability and vomiting. The child also has an unusual sensitivity to noise. Despite having a hearty appetite, the child gains weight slowly and has a slight build."
Alopecia totalis,"The patient presents with concerns about significant hair loss, which is not confined to the scalp but also involves eyebrows, eyelashes, and body hair. Initially, there was only patchy hair loss, but it has progressively worsened over time to near total hair loss. There is no history of any previous similar complaints or any family history of such condition. The patient does not have any associated symptoms such as itching, redness, or inflammation in the affected areas. On examination, no scarring or inflammation is evident on the scalp or other areas of hair loss. The patient is otherwise healthy, with no significant past medical history, and is not currently on any medication or treatment that could potentially cause hair loss."
Mastocytosis,"A new patient arrives at primary care with a variety of unexplained symptoms. The individual complains of episodic flushing of the skin, mostly on the face and upper chest. Furthermore, the patient reports occasional bouts of diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and nausea. The individual also experiences recurrent headaches, bouts of lightheadedness, and episodes of rapid heartbeat. Upon examination, the physician may observe dermatological signs including urticaria pigmentosa, spots or lesions on the skin that appear reddish-brown and can itch or blister upon stroking. The patient may also have an abnormally enlarged liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. Lab tests may show elevated levels of tryptase, a substance often found in high levels in the blood of individuals with certain conditions."
Partial deep dermal and full thickness burns,"A new patient presents with complaints of severe pain in localized areas of the skin, some of which appear discolored, ranging from deep red to white or black. Some areas are blistered, while others seem leathery or waxy. The patient is experiencing swelling in and around these areas and reports feeling unusually cold and clammy. They also report experiencing confusion, faintness, or dizziness. There are irregularities in the patient's heart rate and respiratory distress. The patient might also show signs of dehydration, including dry mouth and decreased urination. The severity of pain does not correlate to the visual severity of the burns, as some of the worst looking areas are relatively painless."
Acquired aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage,"A new patient might present to the primary care setting with a sudden and severe headache, often described as the ""worst headache of their life,"" that may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and a stiff neck. The patient may also report a loss of consciousness or seizures. Other signs might include sensitivity to light (photophobia), blurred or double vision, and confusion. In some cases, the patient may exhibit symptoms of a stroke, such as difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of the body, or a sudden, severe decrease in level of consciousness. The patient may also have had a brief loss of consciousness followed by a period of relative alertness before rapidly deteriorating. On examination, signs of meningeal irritation, such as neck rigidity or a positive Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign, may be observed. In addition, the patient may have focal neurological deficits or signs of increased intracranial pressure."
Rett syndrome,"The patient, a young female, presents with a sudden change in behavior and a regression in motor and language skills that were previously normal. On examination, the child shows a marked decrease in social engagement and repetitive hand movements such as wringing or washing. Further observations reveal slowed growth, particularly in the head circumference, and possible signs of breathing irregularities such as hyperventilation or apnea. The child also has difficulty walking or has lost the ability to walk altogether. Despite these challenges, the child seems to have normal muscle tone and reflexes. Cognitive impairment and seizures could also be present. The parents report that the child was developing normally up to 6-18 months of age since when the regression began. Despite the symptoms, standard genetic and metabolic screenings have returned normal results."
Phenylketonuria,"The patient, an infant, presents with a notable decrease in growth rate, failing to meet developmental milestones and displaying a significant delay in motor skills. They also show signs of microcephaly, or an abnormally small head size, and eczema. The infant exhibits behavioral changes such as hyperactivity, seizures, and a distinct musty or mousy odor in their breath and urine. Despite adequate nutrition, they fail to thrive and may demonstrate signs of intellectual disability as they grow older. Furthermore, the infant has fair skin and hair, despite parents having a darker complexion. Laboratory findings may reveal elevated levels of phenylalanine in the blood and decreased tyrosine levels."
Nephroblastoma,"The new patient, a young child, presents with discomfort or pain in the abdomen, often reporting a noticeable abdominal mass. Additional symptoms include blood in the urine, hypertension, and potentially unexplained weight loss. Physical examination confirms the presence of an abdominal mass and persistent high blood pressure. Further investigations may reveal anemia and abnormal kidney function. The child might also exhibit signs of malaise, such as loss of appetite or fatigue."
Familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine,"The patient presents with recurrent episodes of severe, unilateral throbbing headaches, typically preceded by temporary neurological symptoms that affect only one side of the body. These symptoms may include visual disturbances such as blind spots, flashing lights, or zigzagging lines, and motor weakness that could range from slight to severe. Additionally, the patient reports experiencing sensory disturbances like tingling or numbness, and difficulty with coordination and balance. In some instances, the patient may also report experiencing speech difficulties, confusion, and even temporary memory loss. Some of these episodes have been associated with nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sound, and smell. Family history reveals similar symptoms in other family members. These symptoms seem to resolve completely between episodes, however, they cause significant distress and impact daily activities during episodes."
Acute myeloid leukemia,"The patient presents with persistent fatigue and weakness, which they initially attributed to overwork but has not improved despite resting. They have also noticed that they are becoming breathless even with minimal exertion. The patient has been experiencing recurrent infections over the last few months, which take longer than usual to resolve. They have also reported spontaneous bruising, particularly on the legs, and bleeding gums while brushing their teeth. They have also been feeling generally unwell with occasional fever and night sweats. On examination, there is noted pallor and the presence of petechiae on the skin. A complete blood count reveals anemia, thrombocytopenia, and an unusually high white blood cell count."
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome,"Upon initial examination, the patient, possibly a young child, presents with a deteriorating neurological state, including severe irritability, decreased feeding, abnormal posturing, and a significant regression in developmental milestones. A physical examination may also reveal abnormal muscle tone, involuntary movements, and a peculiar white appearance in the back of the eye. Furthermore, the patient may have a history of frequent infections, despite having a normal immune response. Lab tests might show an elevated level of white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid and high amounts of certain molecules (alpha interferon and interferon-stimulated genes) in the blood, suggesting a chronic viral infection, although no specific viral agent is identified. The patient's parents might also report episodes of fever without any clear infection. Imaging studies may reveal calcifications in certain areas of the brain, along with brain atrophy and white matter abnormalities. Genetic testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,"A new patient arrives at the primary care clinic exhibiting a variety of symptoms. The patient is a young female who has been experiencing signs of virilization, such as excessive body hair growth and a deepening of the voice. Additionally, she has been experiencing irregular menstruation. Upon physical examination, the patient shows signs of hirsutism and clitoromegaly. The patient's parents also report that she had a rapid growth spurt in early childhood, but her growth has since slowed, resulting in a shorter than average stature. Preliminary blood tests reveal an abnormal hormonal profile, with elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens, and a decreased level of cortisol. Further, the patient has a history of hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, and reports episodes of severe fatigue and low blood pressure. These symptoms and findings suggest an underlying endocrine disorder."
Dysbetalipoproteinemia,"The patient presents with multiple non-healing skin lesions, particularly on their palms, elbows, knees, and buttocks, which they describe as yellowish in color and slightly raised. They report occasional mild to moderate abdominal pain, particularly after consuming fatty foods. Upon physical examination, the presence of corneal arcus or a grayish-white ring around the cornea is observed. The patient's medical history reveals a pattern of moderately elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels despite dietary interventions. They also have a family history of early-onset heart disease. Furthermore, the patient mentions episodes of memory loss and confusion, raising concerns about potential neurological issues."
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,"A new patient may present with complaints of unexplained fainting episodes, palpitations, dizziness, or lightheadedness, especially during or after physical activity or emotional stress. These symptoms may be accompanied by a family history of sudden cardiac death at a young age or unexplained fainting. Upon examination, the patient's resting electrocardiogram (ECG) might be normal, however, during exercise or stress testing, the ECG may show abnormal heart rhythms, particularly ventricular arrhythmias. Despite these symptoms, the patient may have a normal structural heart upon imaging tests."
Septo-optic dysplasia spectrum,"The new patient presents with a combination of visual and hormonal disturbances. Notably, there is a report of visual problems, including decreased acuity, nystagmus, or strabismus. The patient's medical history and physical exam may reveal signs of pituitary hormone deficiencies, such as poor growth and development or hypoglycemia. Additionally, neurological symptoms such as delayed motor development, learning difficulties, or seizures may be present. The patient's mother may also recount a history of complications during pregnancy or delivery, or report she had used alcohol or drugs during the pregnancy. An MRI could reveal underdevelopment or absence of the septum pellucidum and/or optic nerves."
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans,"The patient presents with a small, firm, and painless nodule or patch of skin that has been slowly growing, often over the course of several months to years. It is often located on the trunk, but can also be found on the limbs or the head and neck area. The lesion might be pink, red, or purple, and may initially resemble a bruise that doesn't heal. It's not typically associated with any systemic symptoms, such as fever or weight loss. The patient may report that the lesion has slowly increased in size, but it generally doesn't cause discomfort or pain unless it starts to compress nearby nerves or structures. The patient may note that the growth is not responsive to topical therapies and does not appear to be an insect bite, wart, or other common skin condition."
Duane retraction syndrome,"The patient presents with clinical complaints of abnormal eye movement, often highlighting an inability to move one or both eyes outward towards the ear or inward towards the nose. This limited eye mobility may be accompanied by eye misalignment (strabismus), causing the patient to suffer from double vision. The patient may also report that one or both eyes appear to be ""pulling back"" into their eye socket and the eye opening narrows (retraction) when they try to look to the side. This could be more prominent in one eye, leading to a head turn or tilt to compensate for the vision disturbance. A minor but noticeable drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), or an upward movement of the eye when the mouth is opened (the upshoot or downshoot phenomenon) may also be observed. Despite these symptoms, the patient's vision quality is typically unaffected."
Sickle cell anemia,"This patient presents with fatigue and shortness of breath, notably even after short periods of physical exertion. They also describe episodes of unusual pain that can fluctuate in intensity and location, often concentrated in the chest, abdomen, or joints, with no clear cause. The individual mentions having frequent infections and slow healing wounds. Notably, they exhibit jaundice, with a yellowish tint to the skin and eyes. Laboratory tests indicate anemia and show atypically shaped red blood cells. Family history reveals that similar symptoms or conditions may have been present in other family members."
Polymalformative genetic syndrome with increased risk of developing cancer,"The patient presents with a myriad of complaints, including fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and occasional mild pain in various parts of the body. Notable findings include multiple anomalies in body formation such as asymmetrical limbs, irregular skull shape, and congenital heart defects. Skin examination reveals a variety of pigmentation abnormalities, including hyperpigmentation spots and hypopigmented patches. Furthermore, the patient has a history of recurrent infections since childhood, suggesting a potentially compromised immune system. Family history reveals multiple close relatives with various types of cancer at relatively young ages. Preliminary blood tests also show abnormalities in certain markers that might suggest a predisposition to malignancies."
Aplasia cutis congenita,"The patient presents with unexplained, congenital scalp defects that may appear as one or more hairless, scar-like lesions, sometimes with a membranous covering. These cutaneous defects may vary in size and shape and are often accompanied by an abnormal formation of the skull bone beneath the affected area. Additional anomalies could be reported as well, such as limb, nail, and cardiovascular abnormalities, gastrointestinal and genitourinary anomalies, and presence of a hernia. The patient’s family history might reveal instances of similar symptoms, suggesting a possible genetic factor. The condition does not seem to cause pain or discomfort, but the patient or their caregivers express concern about the unusual appearance and potential complications."
Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"The patient, a young boy, presents with a recent history of difficulty in walking, falling, and an unusual gait. His parents have noticed that he seems to be having trouble keeping up with his peers during physical activity and has been struggling to climb stairs, often using his hands and arms to 'walk' up his body from a kneeling position, a phenomenon known as Gower's sign. Additionally, he has been experiencing some muscle weakness, particularly in his lower limbs, and some muscle wasting. The parents report that he was late in reaching milestones such as walking, and his teachers have noted learning and behavioral difficulties. Physical examination reveals calf pseudohypertrophy and a positive Gower's sign."
Dravet syndrome,"The patient, typically a young child, might present with a history of prolonged or recurrent seizures that started in the first year of life, often triggered by fever, hot baths, or getting warm. Despite normal early development, parents may notice a slowing of the child's development and a possible loss of already acquired skills. The seizures may be of different types and may not respond well to standard seizure medications. Other symptoms like ataxia, unsteady gait, and hyperactivity may also be observed. Additionally, the child could have a history of sleep disturbances, orthopedic issues, or dysautonomia, such as fluctuations in body temperature and heart rate. In between seizures, the child may appear normal, but cognitive, motor, and behavioral delays become more apparent with age. Genetic testing may reveal mutations in the SCN1A gene."
