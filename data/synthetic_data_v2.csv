Disease,Detailed
Down syndrome,"The new patient, a young child, presents several features of concern. Notably, the child exhibits delayed developmental milestones such as not meeting the expected markers for speech and motor skills. The child has hypotonia, or diminished muscle tone, and often appears floppy. They also display characteristic facial features such as upwardly slanting eyes, a flat nasal bridge, and a protruding tongue. There's evidence of congenital heart disease, specifically a murmur suggestive of an atrial septal defect. The child's parents report frequent infections, particularly of the respiratory tract. Additionally, the child exhibits minor physical anomalies such as a single transverse palmar crease and a smaller than average size and weight for their age. Cognitive assessment indicates mild to moderate intellectual disability."
Neural tube defect,"The new patient presents with complaints of persistent lower back pain and difficulty in walking. Notably, there is an abnormal curvature of the spine, and some areas of the skin overlying the spine exhibit unusual pigmentation or hair growth. A physical examination reveals a lack of sensation in certain areas of the skin, and muscle weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs. The patient also reports occasional incontinence and constipation. Upon further investigation, there is a history of delayed milestones during early childhood development, with specific difficulties in coordination and motor skills. These signs and symptoms may suggest a possible congenital malformation affecting the patient’s spinal cord and vertebral column.
"
Cleft lip/palate,"The patient presents with difficulties in feeding, frequent ear infections, and issues with speech – specifically a nasal-sounding voice. Physical examination reveals abnormal facial appearance including a notch in the lip, split in the roof of the mouth or a split in the soft tissue at the back of the mouth. Dental anomalies such as missing or extra teeth, and misaligned teeth may also be observed. There may be hearing loss due to recurrent ear infections. Furthermore, the patient may exhibit challenges in social interactions due to appearance and speech issues."
Tumor of endocrine glands,"The patient presents with persistent fatigue and unexplained weight loss despite maintaining a consistent diet and lifestyle. They have been experiencing frequent headaches and visual disturbances, along with episodes of high blood pressure and palpitations. They also report a noticeable change in bowel movements, increased frequency of urination, and persistent skin changes such as darkening or thickening of skin in certain areas. A physical examination reveals a palpable mass in the neck region and swelling of the extremities. The patient also has a family history of similar health issues. Blood tests show abnormal levels of certain hormones, and imaging tests reveal the presence of a mass in the region of one or more of their endocrine glands."
Cleft palate,"The new patient presents with a history of frequent ear infections, nasal speak, and challenges swallowing, which often result in choking or regurgitation of food through the nose. The patient also reports hearing problems and speech difficulties, including articulation issues and a voice that sounds hypernasal. Their medical history includes frequent sinus infections. Upon physical examination, the physician observes an abnormally shaped palate, with a notable split or notch at the back of the mouth, and a bifid uvula – a uvula that appears to be split or double. Auditory testing also suggests the presence of middle ear fluid, which could be contributing to the patient's reported hearing difficulties."
"Renal agenesis, unilateral","The patient presents with recurrent urinary tract infections, lower back or flank pain, and high blood pressure. The individual may also report general malaise, fatigue, and unexplained weight loss. The patient could show signs of decreased kidney function, including frequent urination, especially at night, and blood in the urine. Abdominal examination might reveal palpable mass on one side, or there may be inconsistencies in kidney size during imaging studies. Notably, the patient may have a history of congenital anomalies or family history of kidney diseases, as well as unexplained hypertension or proteinuria. Despite these symptoms, the individual's remaining kidney may be compensating, resulting in relatively normal lab results."
Pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection,"The patient presents with a sudden onset of symptoms including fever, fatigue, and chills. They report a persistent, productive cough with greenish or yellowish sputum and occasional blood streaks. There is notable shortness of breath, even with mild exertion, and chest pain that intensifies during deep breathing or coughing. The patient also mentions loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss. On physical examination, the patient may show signs of respiratory distress such as rapid breathing and increased heart rate. Lung auscultation reveals crackles and decreased breath sounds in certain lung areas. The patient has a previous history of frequent hospitalizations and has been on long-term ventilation or has cystic fibrosis, which may predispose them to certain types of bacterial infections."
"47,XYY syndrome","The patient, a young male, presents with physical attributes including taller than average stature, and potentially notable facial features such as a large forehead or widely spaced eyes. He may have a history of developmental delays, particularly in speech and language skills. The patient might also have difficulties with motor skills, such as coordination or handwriting. Behavioral issues could be present, such as impulsivity, attention deficit, or hyperactivity, and the patient might also be experiencing learning difficulties or lower than average IQ. Additionally, he may also exhibit symptoms of anxiety or social difficulties, and there might be a history of delayed puberty or infertility. Despite these potential signs, it's important to note that many individuals with this genetic makeup may not have any obvious physical or behavioral differences."
Iniencephaly ,"The patient presents with a notable deformity in the head and neck region with a retroflexed head, almost appearing to merge with the back. The patient's skull appears abnormally short and broad, and there is a large defect at the base of the skull and top of the spine. The infant is having difficulty breathing and swallowing due to these abnormalities. Neurological examination indicates a severe impairment, with the infant showing little to no consciousness or responsiveness. The patient also exhibits severe motor and developmental delays, with an inability to move or respond to stimuli appropriately. Additionally, other associated anomalies such as cleft lip and palate, cardiac defects, and limb deformities may also be observed."
Rare cutaneous lupus erythematosus,"The patient presents with complaints of persistent skin rashes and lesions that appear mainly on sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, and arms. They describe the rashes as red, scaly, and round, which sometimes develop into open sores. The patient also reports fatigue, joint pain, and occasional unexplained fever. Upon examination, the patient's rashes have a distinctive disc-like pattern and may exhibit a butterfly-shaped rash across the nose and cheeks. Skin biopsy reveals interface dermatitis and immunofluorescence shows deposition of immunoglobulins at the dermoepidermal junction, supporting a possible autoimmune origin. Additionally, lab tests indicate the presence of specific autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibody (ANA)."
