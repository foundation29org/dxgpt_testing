['Prader-Willi syndrome'],"As a hypothetical doctor analyzing the provided symptoms, I would consider the following potential diagnoses:

+1 Prader-Willi Syndrome:
This genetic disorder is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, poor suck, poor appetite, and intrauterine growth retardation. Patients often have abnormal facial features which can include a high palate. However, lacticaciduria and bilateral cryptorchidism are not typical symptoms of Prader-Willi Syndrome, and abnormal mandible morphology is not a primary feature.

+2 Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome:
This overgrowth disorder can present with neonatal hypotonia, abnormal mandible morphology, and intrauterine growth retardation. Premature rupture of membranes can occur due to the large size of the baby. However, a high palate and abnormality of the palmar creases are not commonly associated with this syndrome, and lacticaciduria is not a recognized symptom.

+3 Pierre Robin Sequence:
This condition often includes a high palate and abnormal mandible morphology, specifically a small, set back mandible. Neonatal hypotonia and poor suck can also be present due to the difficulty in managing the airway and feeding. Intrauterine growth retardation and premature rupture of membranes are not typical symptoms, and lacticaciduria and bilateral cryptorchidism are not associated with Pierre Robin Sequence.

+4 Noonan Syndrome:
Patients with Noonan Syndrome can exhibit neonatal hypotonia, poor suck, and abnormal facial features which may include a high palate. Cryptorchidism is also a common feature in males with this condition. However, intrauterine growth retardation is not a hallmark of Noonan Syndrome, and lacticaciduria is not a recognized symptom.

+5 Zellweger Spectrum Disorder:
This is a group of rare congenital disorders characterized by abnormalities in the metabolism of very-long-chain fatty acids, which can lead to lacticaciduria. Neonatal hypotonia and poor suck are common symptoms. However, a high palate and abnormal mandible morphology are not typical features, and bilateral cryptorchidism is not commonly associated with this disorder.

+6 Myotonic Dystrophy:
This inherited disorder can present with neonatal hypotonia, poor suck, and intrauterine growth retardation. Abnormalities of the palmar creases can occur due to myotonia. However, a high palate and abnormal mandible morphology are not primary features, and lacticaciduria and bilateral cryptorchidism are not typical symptoms of Myotonic Dystrophy.

Each of these potential diseases shares some symptoms with the patient's presentation but also has discrepancies. Further testing, including genetic testing, metabolic studies, and detailed physical examination, would be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis and provide appropriate management for the patient."

"['Neonatal Marfan syndrome', 'Marfan syndrome']","As a hypothetical doctor assessing the symptoms presented, I would consider the following differential diagnoses:

+1 Marfan Syndrome:
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. Patients with Marfan syndrome often exhibit lens subluxation, scoliosis, and high myopia. These symptoms align with the patient's reported symptoms of lens subluxation, scoliosis, and high myopia. However, lens luxation is a more severe displacement than subluxation and is not as commonly associated with Marfan syndrome. Low back pain could be related to scoliosis but is not a defining feature of Marfan syndrome.

+2 Homocystinuria:
Homocystinuria is a metabolic disorder characterized by an excess of homocysteine in the urine. It can lead to lens subluxation and high myopia, which are symptoms the patient has. Scoliosis and low back pain may also be associated with the condition. Lens luxation can occur in severe cases, which matches the patient's symptom of lens luxation.

+3 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues and can cause hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. While lens subluxation and scoliosis can be seen in some types of EDS, high myopia is less common. Lens luxation is not typically associated with EDS, and low back pain could be related to joint hypermobility but is not specific to EDS.

+4 Weill-Marchesani Syndrome:
This rare genetic disorder is characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, and ocular abnormalities. Patients may experience lens subluxation or luxation and high myopia. Scoliosis is not a common feature of Weill-Marchesani Syndrome, and low back pain is not specifically associated with this condition.

+5 Stickler Syndrome:
Stickler Syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect the eyes, joints, and hearing. It can lead to high myopia and sometimes scoliosis. Lens subluxation is less commonly associated with Stickler Syndrome, and lens luxation is not a typical feature. Low back pain could be related to joint problems but is not a hallmark symptom of Stickler Syndrome.

In summary, the patient's symptoms of lens subluxation, scoliosis, low back pain, high myopia, and lens luxation are most closely aligned with Homocystinuria, although Marfan Syndrome is also a strong contender given the commonality of the symptoms. Further diagnostic testing, including genetic testing and metabolic screening, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."

['Brugada syndrome'],"As a hypothetical doctor analyzing the provided symptoms, I would consider the following potential diseases:

+1. Ventricular Fibrillation:
Common Symptoms: The patient has 'Ventricular fibrillation' which is a life-threatening heart rhythm that results in rapid, erratic electrical impulses. This can lead to collapse and sudden cardiac death if not treated immediately.
Not Present Symptoms: Typically, ventricular fibrillation does not cause pneumonia, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, viral hepatitis, or cough. ST segment elevation can be associated with conditions that lead to ventricular fibrillation but is not a symptom of the arrhythmia itself.

+2. Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack):
Common Symptoms: 'ST segment elevation' is often indicative of a heart attack, and 'Exercise intolerance' could be a symptom as well. 'Dyspnea' is also a common symptom of a heart attack.

+3. Pneumonia:
Common Symptoms: The patient has 'Pneumonia' which is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. 'Cough' and 'Dyspnea' are common symptoms of pneumonia.
Not Present Symptoms: 'Ventricular fibrillation', 'Exercise intolerance', 'Viral hepatitis', and 'ST segment elevation' are not typical symptoms of pneumonia.

+4. Congestive Heart Failure:
Common Symptoms: 'Dyspnea' and 'Exercise intolerance' are symptoms of congestive heart failure, where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively.

['Myasthenia gravis'],"+1 Myasthenia Gravis:
Common Symptoms:
- Bilateral ptosis: This is a classic symptom of Myasthenia Gravis, where there is a drooping of both eyelids.
- EMG: decremental response of compound muscle action potential to repetitive nerve stimulation: This is a diagnostic hallmark of Myasthenia Gravis, indicating a defect in neuromuscular transmission.
- Fatigable weakness: Patients with Myasthenia Gravis often experience muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest.
- Upper limb muscle weakness: This is a common presentation in Myasthenia Gravis, affecting the proximal muscles.
- Difficulty climbing stairs: This activity requires significant muscle strength, which can be compromised in Myasthenia Gravis.
- Difficulty standing: Proximal muscle weakness can make it hard for patients to stand from a seated position.
- EMG: repetitive nerve stimulation abnormality: This finding is consistent with the neuromuscular transmission defect seen in Myasthenia Gravis.
- Favorable response of weakness to acetylcholine esterase inhibitors: This is a therapeutic test that can confirm the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis, as these medications increase the availability of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.
- Abnormal levator palpebrae superioris morphology: This muscle is often affected in Myasthenia Gravis, leading to ptosis.

Non-Common Symptoms:
- None of the listed symptoms are uncommon in Myasthenia Gravis; all are associated with the disease.

+2 Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS):
Common Symptoms:
- EMG: decremental response of compound muscle action potential to repetitive nerve stimulation: Similar to Myasthenia Gravis, LEMS can show a decremental response, but typically improves with continued stimulation.
- Fatigable weakness: Muscle weakness that improves with activity is a feature of LEMS.
- Upper limb muscle weakness: This can also be seen in LEMS, although it is usually less pronounced than in Myasthenia Gravis.
- Difficulty climbing stairs and standing: These symptoms can occur due to muscle weakness in LEMS.

Non-Common Symptoms:
- Bilateral ptosis: While ptosis can occur in LEMS, it is not as prominent as in Myasthenia Gravis.
- EMG: repetitive nerve stimulation abnormality: The pattern of abnormality may differ from that seen in Myasthenia Gravis.
- Favorable response of weakness to acetylcholine esterase inhibitors: LEMS typically shows a lesser response to these inhibitors compared to Myasthenia Gravis.
- Abnormal levator palpebrae superioris morphology: This specific abnormality is not a hallmark of LEMS.

['Myasthenia gravis'],"+1 Myasthenia Gravis:
Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles under voluntary control. It is caused by a defect in the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles. Common symptoms include ptosis (drooping of one or both eyelids), diplopia (double vision), which may be horizontal or vertical, and can affect one or both eyes. Muscle weakness aggravated by activity and improved by rest is typical. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dyspnea (difficulty breathing), and generalized muscle weakness are also associated with this condition. The EMG findings of decremental response of compound muscle action potential to repetitive nerve stimulation are diagnostic for Myasthenia Gravis. The patient's symptoms of bilateral ptosis, diplopia, dysphagia, dyspnea, generalized muscle weakness, easy fatigability, EMG findings, fatigable weakness, upper limb muscle weakness, weakness of muscles of respiration, impaired mastication, lower limb muscle weakness, and unilateral ptosis are all consistent with Myasthenia Gravis. The patient does not exhibit symptoms that are not consistent with Myasthenia Gravis.

Unlike Myasthenia Gravis, the muscle weakness in LEMS typically improves with repeated use. Symptoms can include proximal muscle weakness, dysphagia, and autonomic symptoms such as dry mouth. The EMG may show a decremental response of compound muscle action potential to repetitive nerve stimulation, similar to Myasthenia Gravis. The patient's symptoms of generalized muscle weakness, dysphagia, and the EMG findings could suggest LEMS, but the improvement of muscle strength with activity, a hallmark of LEMS, is not mentioned as a symptom in the patient.

+4 Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD):
Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, especially involving the eyelids (ptosis) and throat (dysphagia). Symptoms typically appear in middle age and include bilateral ptosis and difficulty swallowing. Muscle weakness in OPMD is not typically fatigable, which distinguishes it from Myasthenia Gravis. The patient's symptoms of bilateral ptosis and dysphagia are consistent with OPMD, but the presence of fatigable weakness and the specific EMG findings are not typical for OPMD.

+5 Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS):
Guillain-Barré Syndrome is an acute polyneuropathy, often triggered by an infection, that can lead to rapid muscle weakness and paralysis. Symptoms include symmetrical muscle weakness that usually starts in the lower limbs and ascends to the upper limbs and face. Respiratory muscle weakness can lead to dyspnea. The progression of weakness in GBS is typically rapid over days"

+7 Celiac"
['Gitelman syndrome'],"As a hypothetical doctor analyzing the presented symptoms, I would consider the following potential diagnoses:

+1 Gitelman Syndrome:
Gitelman syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys' ability to reabsorb certain electrolytes. Patients with Gitelman syndrome typically present with renal potassium wasting, hypokalemia, increased urinary potassium, hypocalciuria, and metabolic alkalosis. These symptoms align with the patient's reported symptoms.

+2 Bartter Syndrome:
Bartter syndrome is another genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, but it is different from Gitelman syndrome in some aspects of its presentation and the affected part of the kidney. Patients with Bartter syndrome also exhibit renal potassium wasting, hypokalemia, increased urinary potassium, and metabolic alkalosis. However, they may have normal or increased levels of urinary calcium, which does not completely align with the patient's symptom of hypocalciuria.

+3 Primary Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome):
Primary hyperaldosteronism is a condition characterized by the overproduction of aldosterone, a hormone that increases the reabsorption of sodium and water and the release of potassium by the kidneys. It can lead to symptoms such as hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. However, it typically presents with hypernatremia and hypertension, which are not listed among the patient's symptoms. Additionally, it does not typically cause hypocalciuria or renal potassium wasting as primary symptoms.

+4 Diuretic Abuse:
The chronic use or abuse of certain diuretics can lead to a similar pattern of electrolyte disturbances as seen in the patient's symptoms, including hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and increased urinary potassium. However, diuretic abuse may also cause other symptoms not listed, such as dehydration or changes in blood pressure. The symptom of hypocalciuria may not be consistent with diuretic abuse, depending on the type of diuretic involved.

+5 Magnesium Deficiency:
Magnesium deficiency can lead to renal potassium wasting and hypokalemia because magnesium is required for proper potassium handling in the kidneys. It can also result in metabolic alkalosis. However, magnesium deficiency typically presents with additional symptoms such as muscle cramps, weakness, and arrhythmias, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. The relationship with hypocalciuria is less direct but can be associated in some cases.

In conclusion, based on the symptoms provided, Gitelman syndrome appears to be the most likely diagnosis, as all the listed symptoms are characteristic of this condition. Further diagnostic tests, including genetic testing and measurement of magnesium levels, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential conditions."
