GT,Diagnosis 1
Síndrome de Down,"+1 Down Syndrome:
Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual disability. The symptoms you've described, such as a flat facial profile, upward slanting eyes with epicanthic folds, small ears, a protruding tongue, cognitive delays with an average IQ range of 50-70, hypotonia, and short stature, are all consistent with Down syndrome. The sociability and preference for routine are also common in individuals with Down syndrome. Additionally, heart defects and gastrointestinal issues are known health complications associated with this condition.

+2 Williams Syndrome:
Williams syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. It is characterized by a distinctive, ""elfin"" facial appearance, a low nasal bridge, a long upper lip length, a wide mouth, full lips, and a small chin. Individuals with Williams syndrome tend to be social, friendly, and endearing. They may also have heart issues, such as supravalvular aortic stenosis. However, the facial features and cognitive profile you've described do not fully match those typically seen in Williams syndrome, and the specific cardiovascular issues differ.

+3 Turner Syndrome:
Turner syndrome affects females and results from a missing or partially missing X chromosome. It can cause a variety of medical and developmental problems, including short stature and heart defects. However, Turner syndrome does not typically present with the cognitive delays or the specific facial features you've described, such as epicanthic folds or a flat facial profile. Additionally, Turner syndrome would not affect a mixed-gender group as it exclusively affects females.

+4 Fragile X Syndrome:
Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. Physical features may include large ears, a long face, and a prominent jaw and forehead. While there is some overlap with the cognitive delays and hypotonia, the distinct facial features and the specific physical attributes you've described do not align with Fragile X syndrome.

+5 Prader-Willi Syndrome:
Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that results in a number of physical, mental, and behavioral problems. A key feature of the syndrome is a constant sense of hunger that usually begins at about 2 years of age. While individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome may have cognitive impairments and hypotonia, the facial features and other symptoms you've described do not match this condition. Additionally, the constant hunger and obesity typically associated with Prader-Willi syndrome are not mentioned in your description.

Based on the symptoms provided, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be +1 Down Syndrome:. The described symptoms align closely with the characteristic features of Down syndrome. However, a definitive diagnosis would require genetic testing to confirm the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21."
Anomalías del tubo neural,"+1 Spina Bifida Myelomeningocele:
This is a form of spina bifida where the backbone and spinal canal do not close before birth. The condition matches the patient's symptoms of an open portion of the spinal column and a sac protruding from his back containing part of the spinal cord and nerves. The muscle weakness in the lower limbs and abnormal gait are also consistent with this condition. However, the patient does not show signs of cognitive impairment or developmental delay, which can sometimes be associated with this condition.

+2 Caudal Regression Syndrome:
This rare disorder is characterized by abnormal development of the lower spine. It can present with a range of abnormalities, from simple tailbone malformation to severe cases involving the lumbar spine. The patient's significant defect along his spine could be suggestive of this syndrome. However, the presence of a sac containing part of the spinal cord and nerves is not typical for caudal regression syndrome, which usually does not involve a protruding sac.

+3 Sacral Agenesis:
This is a congenital disorder where there is a partial or complete absence of the sacrum and lower spine. It can lead to muscle weakness and abnormalities in gait, similar to what the patient exhibits. However, sacral agenesis does not typically present with an open spinal column or a protruding sac, which are observed in this patient.

+4 Meningocele:
This is a type of spina bifida where a sac of fluid protrudes through an opening in the baby's back, but the spinal cord does not protrude. The patient's symptoms include a visible sac protruding from his back, but since the sac contains a portion of the spinal cord and nerves, it is more consistent with myelomeningocele rather than meningocele.

+5 Tethered Cord Syndrome:
This condition occurs when the spinal cord is attached to the spine and cannot move freely. This can lead to muscle weakness and abnormalities in gait, which the patient has. However, the presence of an open spinal column and a protruding sac filled with spinal cord and nerves is not typical of tethered cord syndrome.

+6 Lipomyelomeningocele:
This is a form of spina bifida where a fatty mass (lipoma) is attached to the spinal cord and can protrude through an opening in the spine. The patient's symptoms of a protruding sac could be consistent with this condition. However, the sac in lipomyelomeningocele typically contains fat tissue along with the spinal cord and nerves, and this specific detail is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

Given the patient's symptoms and the mother's history of not taking prenatal vitamins or folic acid supplements, which are known risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is Spina Bifida Myelomeningocele (+1). However, further diagnostic imaging and tests would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Fisura labiopalatina,"+1 Cleft Lip and Palate:
This congenital disorder is characterized by a physical split or separation in the upper lip (cleft lip) and/or a gap in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate), which the patient exhibits. Symptoms in common with the patient include difficulty in feeding, unusual facial features, a split in the upper lip, an opening in the roof of the mouth, hypernasality, and articulation disorders. The patient's growth rate being slightly below average is also consistent with this condition. The familial pattern indicated by genetic testing supports the diagnosis, as cleft lip and palate can have a genetic component. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been specified, as the provided symptoms align well with cleft lip and palate.

+2 Pierre Robin Sequence:
This rare condition is characterized by a smaller-than-normal lower jaw (micrognathia), a tongue that is placed further back than normal (glossoptosis), and cleft palate. Symptoms in common with the patient include difficulty in feeding and cleft palate. However, the patient does not exhibit micrognathia or glossoptosis as described in the symptoms. The recurrent ear infections and familial pattern are not specific to Pierre Robin Sequence, although they can be associated with various syndromic conditions.

+3 Stickler Syndrome:
Stickler Syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting collagen which can lead to a range of symptoms including cleft palate, distinctive facial appearance, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and joint problems. Symptoms in common with the patient include cleft palate, unusual facial features, and a potential genetic link. However, the patient does not present with eye abnormalities, hearing loss, or joint problems as part of the described symptoms. The recurrent ear infections could be related, as middle ear issues are common in Stickler Syndrome.

+4 Velocardiofacial Syndrome (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome):
This genetic disorder is characterized by cleft palate, heart defects, characteristic facial features, learning difficulties, and immune system problems. Symptoms in common with the patient include cleft palate, unusual facial features, and speech difficulties. The patient's growth rate being slightly below average and the familial pattern could also fit this syndrome. However, the patient does not exhibit heart defects or immune system problems as part of the described symptoms.

+5 Treacher Collins Syndrome:
This is a condition that affects the development of bones and other tissues of the face and can lead to underdeveloped facial bones, cleft palate, and ear abnormalities. Symptoms in common with the patient include cleft palate and unusual facial features. However, the patient does not have the underdeveloped facial bones or ear abnormalities (apart from infections) that are typical of Treacher Collins Syndrome. The familial pattern could suggest a genetic syndrome, but more specific features of Treacher Collins Syndrome are not described in the patient's symptoms.

Given the symptoms described and the familial pattern, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be Cleft Lip and Palate (+1). However, further investigation and genetic counseling may be necessary to rule out related syndromes or to confirm the presence of a specific genetic condition."
Tumor de las glándulas endocrinas,"+1 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):
EDS is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. Symptoms the patient has in common: unusual skin changes. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: hypermobile joints, stretchy skin, and a tendency to bruise easily.

+2 Carcinoid Syndrome:
Carcinoid syndrome occurs when a carcinoid tumor secretes certain chemicals into your bloodstream, causing a variety of signs and symptoms. Symptoms the patient has in common: unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, skin changes, frequent headaches, dizziness, changes in bowel movements, and episodes of palpitations. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: flushing of the skin, wheezing, or diarrhea.

+3 Pheochromocytoma:
Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of adrenal gland tissue that can trigger an excess production of adrenaline. Symptoms the patient has in common: persistent fatigue, headaches, high blood pressure, palpitations, and a lump in the neck region which could be an enlarged adrenal gland. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: excessive sweating, rapid heartbeat, and tremors.

+4 Paraneoplastic Syndromes:
These syndromes are a group of rare disorders that are triggered by an abnormal immune system response to a cancerous tumor known as a neoplasm. Symptoms the patient has in common: unexplained weight loss, fatigue, skin changes, headaches, dizziness, and changes in bowel movements. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: specific neurological symptoms depending on the type of syndrome.

+5 Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1):
MEN1 is a hereditary condition that affects the endocrine glands, leading to the development of tumors in these glands. Symptoms the patient has in common: unexplained weight loss, fatigue, high blood pressure, palpitations, and a lump in the neck region which could be related to parathyroid, pituitary, or pancreatic tumors. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: ulcers, high calcium levels, and other hormone-related symptoms.

+6 Cushing's Syndrome:
Cushing's syndrome occurs when your body is exposed to high levels of the hormone cortisol for a long time. Symptoms the patient has in common: unexplained weight loss (though Cushing's typically causes weight gain), high blood pressure, and changes in skin. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: a fatty hump between the shoulders, a rounded face, and pink or purple stretch marks.

+7 Lymphoma:
Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Symptoms the patient has in common: unexplained weight loss, fatigue, a lump in the neck region which could be an enlarged lymph node, and a family history of various types of cancers. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: night sweats, fever, and itchy skin.

+8 Neurofibromatosis:
Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form on nerve tissue. Symptoms the patient has in common: lumps which could be neurofibromas. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: café-au-lait spots, freckling in the armpits or groin area, and bone deformities.

+9 Acromegaly:
Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when your pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. Symptoms the patient has in common: changes in bowel movements and increased blood pressure. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: enlarged hands and feet, enlarged facial features, and joint pain.

+10 Addison's Disease:
Addison's disease results from damage to the adrenal cortex which leads to insufficient production of the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Symptoms the patient has in common: fatigue, dizziness, and changes in skin pigmentation. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: craving for salt, low blood glucose, and abdominal pain.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history of cancer, it is important to conduct further tests, including imaging and possibly biopsies, to rule out or confirm any of these conditions, particularly those associated with neoplastic syndromes."
Paladar hendido,"+1 Cleft Palate:
A cleft palate is a congenital split or opening in the roof of the mouth that occurs when the tissue doesn't fuse together during pregnancy. Symptoms in common: The patient has a noticeable opening in the roof of his mouth, which is characteristic of a cleft palate. This could also explain the difficulties with feeding and the distinctive nasal quality in the baby's cries. Symptoms not in common: Speech delays are difficult to assess at 6 months old, as infants typically do not have well-developed speech; however, cleft palate can lead to speech issues later in life.

+2 Pierre Robin Sequence:
Pierre Robin Sequence is a condition present at birth, characterized by a smaller-than-normal lower jaw (micrognathia), a tongue that falls back in the throat (glossoptosis), and difficulties with breathing. Symptoms in common: The feeding difficulties and ear infections could be related to this condition. Symptoms not in common: The patient does not present with a smaller-than-normal lower jaw or issues with breathing specifically mentioned, which are typical for Pierre Robin Sequence.

+3 Velocardiofacial Syndrome (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome):
This genetic disorder is characterized by cleft palate, heart defects, characteristic facial features, and learning challenges. Symptoms in common: The patient's cleft palate, distinctive nasal cries, and broad, flattened nose bridge could be indicative of this syndrome. Symptoms not in common: Heart defects and learning challenges cannot be confirmed at this age, and the patient's thin upper lip is not a typical feature.

+4 Stickler Syndrome:
Stickler Syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting the body's connective tissue and can lead to a distinctive facial appearance, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and joint problems. Symptoms in common: The cleft palate and feeding difficulties could be associated with Stickler Syndrome. Symptoms not in common: The patient does not present with eye abnormalities or joint problems, which are commonly seen in Stickler Syndrome.

+5 Treacher Collins Syndrome:
This is a condition that affects the development of bones and other tissues of the face and can lead to underdeveloped facial bones, cleft palate, and hearing loss. Symptoms in common: The patient's cleft palate and distinctive facial features, such as the broad, flattened nose bridge, could suggest Treacher Collins Syndrome. Symptoms not in common: There is no mention of underdeveloped facial bones or hearing loss, which are commonly associated with this syndrome.

+6 DiGeorge Syndrome (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome):
Similar to Velocardiofacial Syndrome, DiGeorge Syndrome is caused by a deletion on chromosome 22 and can result in heart defects, immune deficiencies, cleft palate, and facial anomalies. Symptoms in common: The cleft palate and potential speech delays could be related to DiGeorge Syndrome. Symptoms not in common: There is no mention of heart defects or immune deficiencies, which are significant aspects of this condition.

+7 Van der Woude Syndrome:
This is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by lower lip pits, cleft lip, and/or cleft palate. Symptoms in common: The patient's cleft palate aligns with this syndrome. Symptoms not in common: The patient does not present with lower lip pits or a cleft lip, which are key features of Van der Woude Syndrome.

+8 CHARGE Syndrome:
CHARGE Syndrome is a complex syndrome involving extensive medical and physical difficulties, including coloboma, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, growth and developmental retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities. Symptoms in common: The cleft palate and potential for ear infections could be part of this syndrome. Symptoms not in common: There is no mention of coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, or ear abnormalities, which are typically seen in CHARGE Syndrome.

Please note that these are potential rare diseases based on the symptoms provided, and further diagnostic tests, including genetic testing and consultations with specialists, would be necessary to confirm any diagnosis."
Agenesia renal unilateral,"+1 Renal Agenesis:
Renal agenesis is a rare condition where a person is born with only one kidney. Symptoms can vary, but high blood pressure and proteinuria (protein in the urine) can be associated with this condition. The patient's ultrasound showing an absent right kidney aligns with this diagnosis. However, renal agenesis is typically identified much earlier in life, and the patient's history of recurrent urinary tract infections is not a common symptom of this disease.

Common Symptoms:
- Absent kidney (right kidney absent)
- Elevated blood pressure (slightly elevated blood pressure)
- Proteinuria (higher than normal level of protein in urine)

Uncommon Symptoms:
- Recurrent urinary tract infections (not typically associated with renal agenesis)
- Lower back pain (not specifically indicative of renal agenesis)

+2 Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD):
PKD is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. It can lead to hypertension and blood in the urine. However, PKD usually affects both kidneys and is hereditary, which does not match the patient's presentation of a normal left kidney and no family history of kidney diseases.

Common Symptoms:
- Hypertension (slightly elevated blood pressure)
- Hematuria (occasional blood in urine)

Uncommon Symptoms:
- Absent right kidney (PKD typically affects both kidneys)
- No family history of kidney diseases (PKD is hereditary)
- Recurrent urinary tract infections (not a primary symptom of PKD)

+3 Nutcracker Syndrome:
This syndrome occurs when the left renal vein is compressed, which can lead to symptoms like hematuria and flank pain. However, it is usually associated with a normal or varicose left renal vein, not an absent kidney, and does not typically cause proteinuria or an absent right kidney.

Common Symptoms:
- Hematuria (occasional blood in urine)
- Flank pain (lower back pain on the right side)

Uncommon Symptoms:
- Absent right kidney (not a feature of Nutcracker Syndrome)
- Proteinuria (not typically seen in Nutcracker Syndrome)

+4 Loin Pain Hematuria Syndrome (LPHS):
LPHS is a rare condition that causes persistent or recurrent loin pain and hematuria. The cause of LPHS is not well understood, and it does not involve an absent kidney or proteinuria as primary symptoms.

Common Symptoms:
- Hematuria (occasional blood in urine)
- Flank pain (lower back pain on the right side)

Uncommon Symptoms:
- Absent right kidney (not associated with LPHS)
- Proteinuria (not a typical symptom of LPHS)

+5 Urological Malignancies:
While not a single disease, cancers of the urinary tract can sometimes present with blood in the urine, flank pain, and proteinuria. The absence of a kidney could be due to surgical removal in the past, which the patient might not be aware of or might not have disclosed. However, this would not explain the absence of a kidney from birth and would typically have a more noticeable history.

Common Symptoms:
- Hematuria (occasional blood in urine)
- Flank pain (lower back pain on the right side)
- Proteinuria (higher than normal level of protein in urine)

Uncommon Symptoms:
- Absent right kidney (could be due to past surgical removal, but not congenital)

Given the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings, Renal Agenesis seems to be the most likely diagnosis, but further investigation is needed to rule out other conditions and to understand the cause of the recurrent urinary tract infections. A detailed medical history, further imaging studies, and possibly genetic testing may be required to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan."
Neumonía causada por infección por pseudomonas aeruginosa,"+1 Legionnaires' disease:
Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Symptoms include high fever, cough with sputum, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The patient's symptoms of high fever, persistent cough producing greenish sputum, and shortness of breath are consistent with Legionnaires' disease. The abnormal shadows on the chest X-ray could also be indicative of this disease. However, Legionnaires' disease is typically associated with Legionella pneumophila, not a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria, which the patient's sputum culture has confirmed. Additionally, the history of COPD and recurrent respiratory infections could suggest a different etiology.

+2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that can cause pneumonia, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic lung diseases like COPD. Symptoms include fever, cough with productive sputum, and difficulty breathing, which align with the patient's presentation. The presence of gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria in the sputum culture and the patient's history of COPD and ICU stay with intubation are consistent with this diagnosis. The lack of improvement with broad-spectrum antibiotics could indicate antibiotic resistance, which is common in Pseudomonas infections.

+3 Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia:
Acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that can cause severe pneumonia, especially in hospital settings and among critically ill patients. It can lead to symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which the patient is experiencing. The patient's recent ICU stay and intubation increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including those caused by Acinetobacter. The resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics and the patient's history of recurrent respiratory infections could support this diagnosis. However, further testing would be required to confirm the presence of Acinetobacter baumannii.

+4 Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia:
Klebsiella pneumoniae is another gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that can cause pneumonia, particularly in individuals with chronic lung conditions. Symptoms include high fever, cough with purulent sputum, and breathing difficulties. The patient's symptoms and the presence of gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria in the sputum culture are consistent with Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient's history of COPD and repeated hospital admissions could predispose him to such an infection. The lack of response to antibiotics may suggest a drug-resistant strain, which is increasingly common with Klebsiella infections.

+5 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia pneumonia:
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that is an emerging cause of nosocomial infections, including pneumonia. It often affects immunocompromised patients and those with underlying lung disease. Symptoms can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient's recent ICU stay and exposure to invasive procedures like intubation could have increased the risk of infection with this organism. The persistence of symptoms despite antibiotic treatment could be due to the inherent resistance of Stenotrophomonas to many antibiotics.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and history suggest a nosocomial pneumonia caused by a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium. The lack of response to broad-spectrum antibiotics is concerning and may indicate a resistant organism. Further diagnostic tests, such as specific cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing, are needed to identify the exact pathogen and tailor the antibiotic therapy accordingly."
"Síndrome 47,XYY","+1 Marfan Syndrome:
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, leading to features such as tall stature, long limbs, and sometimes learning difficulties. However, it is also typically associated with cardiovascular abnormalities, which the patient does not exhibit, and there is no family history to suggest this condition.

Common Symptoms:
- Tall stature

Uncommon Symptoms:
- Cardiovascular abnormalities (absent in patient)
- Family history of genetic abnormalities (absent in patient)

+2 Klinefelter Syndrome:
Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal disorder in males where they have an extra X chromosome, often leading to taller stature and learning difficulties. It can also be associated with delayed motor skills and language development. However, patients with Klinefelter syndrome typically have smaller testes and reduced facial and body hair, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

Common Symptoms:
- Tall stature
- Learning difficulties
- Delayed motor skills development

Uncommon Symptoms:
- Smaller testes (not mentioned)
- Reduced facial and body hair (not mentioned)

+3 Sotos Syndrome:
Sotos syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by rapid growth during the early years of life, leading to tall stature. It is also associated with learning disabilities and delayed motor skills. Behavioral issues can be present, and a larger head size is a common feature. However, the absence of a family history makes this diagnosis less likely.

Common Symptoms:
- Tall stature
- Learning difficulties
- Delayed motor skills development
- Larger head size
- Behavioral issues

Uncommon Symptoms:
- Family history of genetic abnormalities (absent in patient)

+4 Fragile X Syndrome:
Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition causing intellectual disability, behavioral challenges, and learning disorders, such as dyslexia. It can also be associated with attention problems and aggressive behaviors. Physical features may include a larger head, but patients often have distinctive facial features and connective tissue problems, which are not reported in this patient.

Common Symptoms:
- Learning difficulties
- Attention span issues
- Aggressive behavior
- Larger head size

Uncommon Symptoms:
- Distinctive facial features (not mentioned)
- Connective tissue problems (not mentioned)

Given the symptoms presented, it is important to conduct further genetic testing and possibly consult with a geneticist to narrow down the diagnosis. The patient's symptoms overlap with several rare conditions, but additional information and testing are required to reach a definitive diagnosis."
Iniencefalia,"+1 Anencephaly:
Anencephaly is a severe congenital condition where a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp is absent. Infants with anencephaly are often born without the front part of the brain (forebrain) and the thinking and coordinating part of the brain (cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum). The condition can lead to a receding forehead and potential underdevelopment of the brain and skull, which are symptoms your patient exhibits. However, anencephaly typically results in stillbirth or death shortly after birth, and it does not usually involve abnormalities in the arrangement of internal organs or excessive skin folding around the neck.

+2 Holoprosencephaly:
Holoprosencephaly is a rare congenital brain malformation resulting from incomplete separation of the right and left hemispheres. Symptoms can include fusion of brain structures with the facial region, a single central cavity or ventricle, and facial abnormalities such as closely spaced eyes or a single eye (cyclopia). The condition can also lead to microcephaly and a receding forehead. However, holoprosencephaly does not typically involve an abnormal arrangement of internal organs or excessive skin folding around the neck.

+3 Patau Syndrome (Trisomy 13):
Patau syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 13. Symptoms can include severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, structural eye defects, and cleft lip or palate. There may also be abnormalities in the heart and kidneys, which aligns with your patient's symptoms. However, Patau syndrome is also associated with polydactyly (extra fingers or toes), which your patient does not exhibit, and it does not typically involve excessive skin folding around the neck.

+4 Meckel-Gruber Syndrome:
Meckel-Gruber Syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by a combination of anomalies. These can include occipital encephalocele (a sac-like protrusion of the brain and the membranes that cover it through an opening in the back of the skull), microcephaly, and abnormalities in the development of the eyes and large cysts in the kidneys. The condition may also present with polydactyly and abnormalities in other organs. While some of the symptoms match your patient's presentation, such as the brain and kidney issues, Meckel-Gruber Syndrome typically involves additional features not observed in your patient, such as the occipital encephalocele.

+5 Turner Syndrome:
Turner Syndrome is a chromosomal disorder affecting females, where one of the X chromosomes is missing or partially missing. It can lead to a variety of medical and developmental problems, including heart defects and kidney abnormalities. However, Turner Syndrome patients typically have normal intelligence and do not exhibit severe underdevelopment of the brain and skull or the fusion of brain structures with the facial region. Additionally, Turner Syndrome is associated with short stature and lymphedema, which are not mentioned in your patient's symptoms.

Given the complexity and rarity of the symptoms presented, further genetic testing and consultation with a specialist in genetic disorders may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis. It is also important to consider that the patient may have a condition that is not yet described in the medical literature."
Lupus eritematoso cutáneo raro,"+1 Lupus Erythematosus:
Lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, especially the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys. The symptoms the patient has in common with this disease include widespread skin rashes that worsen with sunlight exposure, fatigue, joint pain, mouth ulcers, hair loss, and elevated antinuclear antibodies. The presence of interface dermatitis in the skin biopsy is also consistent with lupus. The patient's family history of autoimmune diseases further supports this potential diagnosis.

+2 Dermatomyositis:
Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory disease marked by muscle weakness and a distinctive skin rash. It's an autoimmune condition that can affect both children and adults. The symptoms in common with this disease include skin rashes, particularly those that worsen with sunlight, and fatigue. However, the patient does not exhibit the characteristic muscle weakness associated with dermatomyositis. The presence of antinuclear antibodies could be seen in this condition as well.

+3 Polymorphic Light Eruption (PMLE):
PMLE is a skin condition that causes a delayed skin reaction to sunlight exposure. The symptoms include rashes on sun-exposed areas of the skin, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. However, PMLE typically does not cause joint pain, mouth ulcers, or hair loss, and it is not associated with elevated antinuclear antibodies or a family history of autoimmune diseases.

+4 Sjögren's Syndrome:
Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth, but it can also cause skin rashes, joint pain, and fatigue. The patient's symptoms of mouth ulcers and elevated antinuclear antibodies are common in Sjögren's syndrome. However, the primary symptoms of dry eyes and mouth have not been reported by the patient, and Sjögren's typically does not cause widespread skin rashes after sun exposure.

+5 Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE):
DLE is a chronic skin condition that is a form of lupus erythematosus. It is characterized by disc-shaped, red, inflammatory skin lesions that can lead to scarring, primarily on sun-exposed areas. The patient's symptoms of skin rashes on the face, neck, and arms, as well as fatigue and joint pain, are consistent with DLE. However, the patient's rashes are described as non-scarring, which is less typical for DLE.

+6 Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma):
Systemic sclerosis is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues. While it can cause fatigue, joint pain, and elevated antinuclear antibodies, the patient's symptoms of widespread, non-scarring skin rashes and hair loss are not typical of systemic sclerosis. Additionally, the skin changes in scleroderma are usually more about skin thickening rather than rashes.

Given the patient's symptoms and the results of the laboratory tests and biopsy, Lupus Erythematosus (+1) seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further testing and evaluation by a rheumatologist would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Ausencia congénita bilateral de los conductos deferentes,"+1 Kallmann Syndrome:
Kallmann syndrome is a genetic condition that can lead to delayed or absent puberty and an impaired sense of smell. While this patient does not exhibit signs of hormonal imbalance or issues with the sense of smell, the infertility issues could potentially be related. However, the specific absence of ducts transporting sperm is not a typical feature of Kallmann syndrome, and the patient does not have other common symptoms such as anosmia (lack of sense of smell) or delayed puberty.

+2 Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens (CBAVD):
CBAVD is a condition where the vas deferens, the ducts that carry sperm from the testes to the urethra, are missing. This condition is often found in males with cystic fibrosis or those who are carriers of a cystic fibrosis mutation. The patient's infertility issues and the absence of the vas deferens on both sides are consistent with CBAVD. However, the patient does not exhibit other symptoms typically associated with cystic fibrosis, such as respiratory or digestive problems.

+3 Kartagener Syndrome:
Kartagener syndrome is a subset of primary ciliary dyskinesia, a rare genetic disorder that affects the cilia lining the respiratory tract, the reproductive system, and other parts of the body. It is characterized by situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. While the patient does not show respiratory symptoms or situs inversus (reversed organs), the reproductive issues could be a point of consideration. However, the absence of ducts is not a common feature of this syndrome.

+4 Young Syndrome:
Young syndrome is similar to cystic fibrosis but typically presents later in life. It involves the obstruction of the epididymis, leading to issues with sperm transport. Patients may have a history of bronchitis or sinusitis. The infertility aspect is relevant to the patient's condition, but the absence of a history of respiratory issues and the specific absence of the vas deferens do not align perfectly with Young syndrome.

+5 Non-Obstructive Azoospermia:
Non-obstructive azoospermia is a condition where sperm production is either extremely low or absent, not due to a blockage. This condition can be caused by genetic abnormalities, testicular failure, or other unknown reasons. While this could explain infertility, it does not account for the structural abnormality of missing ducts observed in the patient.

Given the patient's symptoms and the absence of other common signs associated with the above conditions, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be:

+2 Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens (CBAVD):
This condition directly correlates with the patient's reported absence of the ducts necessary for sperm transport and his infertility issues. Further genetic testing, particularly for cystic fibrosis mutations, would be recommended to confirm this diagnosis and to guide potential treatment or management strategies."
Cáncer de ovario,"+1 Ovarian Cancer:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Abdominal bloating, pelvic pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, frequent urination, abnormal growths in the reproductive system, family history of reproductive system-related diseases.
Non-Common Symptoms with Patient: Unexplained weight loss, changes in bowel habits, postmenopausal bleeding.

+2 Leiomyosarcoma of the Uterus:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Pelvic pain, abnormal growths in the reproductive system.
Non-Common Symptoms with Patient: Abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge, a mass or swelling in the abdomen, pain during intercourse.

+3 Ovarian Fibroma:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Abdominal bloating, pelvic pain, abnormal growths in the reproductive system.
Non-Common Symptoms with Patient: Ascites, Meigs' syndrome (presence of ascites and pleural effusion), pain during intercourse.

+4 Endometrial Cancer:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Pelvic pain, abnormal growths in the reproductive system, family history of reproductive system-related diseases.
Non-Common Symptoms with Patient: Vaginal bleeding or discharge not related to menstruation, anemia, unintentional weight loss.

+5 Uterine Fibroids:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Abdominal bloating, pelvic pain, frequent urination, abnormal growths in the reproductive system.
Non-Common Symptoms with Patient: Heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual periods, backache or leg pains.

+6 Lynch Syndrome (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer, HNPCC):
Common Symptoms with Patient: Family history of reproductive system-related diseases.
Non-Common Symptoms with Patient: Increased risk of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and other types of cancer, not necessarily presenting with abnormal growths in the reproductive system.

+7 Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Abdominal bloating, family history of reproductive system-related diseases.
Non-Common Symptoms with Patient: Mucocutaneous pigmentation (dark spots on lips, mouth, hands, feet), increased risk of various types of cancer including gastrointestinal.

+8 Serous Cystadenoma of the Ovary:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Abdominal bloating, pelvic pain, abnormal growths in the reproductive system.
Non-Common Symptoms with Patient: Asymptomatic in many cases, slow-growing, typically benign but can be precancerous or cancerous in some cases.

Given the symptoms and the diagnostic findings, it is important to conduct further tests, including biopsies and possibly genetic testing, to narrow down the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan."
Síndrome de Sjögren primario,"+1 Sjögren's Syndrome:
Sjögren's Syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the body's immune system attacking its own moisture-producing glands. Common symptoms include dry eyes and dry mouth, which the patient has reported. Fatigue and joint pain are also consistent with Sjögren's Syndrome. The presence of anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La) antibodies in the blood is a common finding in this condition. The patient's difficulty swallowing and recurrent dental cavities can be associated with the reduced saliva production seen in Sjögren's Syndrome. The swollen salivary glands upon examination further support this diagnosis. The patient's history of hypothyroidism is notable, as autoimmune diseases can often co-occur. However, the patient does not report any symptoms that are not consistent with Sjögren's Syndrome based on the information provided.

+2 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect any part of the body. Symptoms can include fatigue, joint pain, rashes, and the presence of antinuclear antibodies, which may include anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La). The patient's symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, and occasional rashes align with SLE. However, SLE typically presents with a wider range of systemic symptoms, which the patient does not report, such as kidney involvement, neurological symptoms, and hematological abnormalities.

+3 Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD):
Mixed Connective Tissue Disease is a rare autoimmune disorder that has features of three other connective tissue diseases: SLE, scleroderma, and polymyositis. Patients with MCTD may experience dry eyes, dry mouth, fatigue, joint pain, and rashes, which are all symptoms the patient has. Swollen salivary glands could also be seen in MCTD. However, specific antibodies such as U1-RNP are typically present in MCTD, which are not mentioned in the patient's blood test results.

+4 Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):
Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints but can also involve other tissues and organs. The patient's joint pain could suggest RA, and the family history of rheumatoid arthritis (her mother had RA) could indicate a genetic predisposition. However, RA is typically associated with specific antibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), which are not mentioned in the patient's test results. Additionally, RA does not commonly present with dry eyes and dry mouth.

+5 Polymyositis:
Polymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy characterized by muscle weakness and inflammation. While the patient reports fatigue, which could be related to muscle weakness, the primary symptoms of polymyositis are progressive muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes, which the patient does not report. Additionally, polymyositis does not typically present with dry eyes, dry mouth, or swollen salivary glands.

+6 Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC):
Primary Biliary Cholangitis is a chronic liver disease characterized by the destruction of the bile ducts within the liver. It can lead to fatigue and dry eyes and mouth due to associated Sjögren's Syndrome. However, the patient does not report symptoms typically associated with liver disease, such as jaundice, itching, or right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Blood tests for PBC often show elevated liver enzymes and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), which are not mentioned in the patient's results.

Based on the symptoms and test results provided, Sjögren's Syndrome (+1) appears to be the most likely diagnosis for this patient. However, further evaluation and testing would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Leucemia linfocítica crónica de células B,"+1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL):
CLL is a type of cancer that starts from cells that become certain white blood cells (called lymphocytes) in the bone marrow. The cancer (leukemia) cells start in the bone marrow but then go into the blood. In CLL, the leukemia cells often build up slowly. Many people don't have any symptoms for at least a few years. In time, the cells can spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen.

Common symptoms with the patient:
- Fatigue
- Weight loss
- Frequent infections
- Night sweats
- Feeling of fullness in the abdomen
- Enlargement of the lymph nodes
- Swelling in the spleen
- High white blood cell count with a predominance of lymphocytes
- Slow progression of symptoms
- Family history of blood cell disorders

Symptoms not in common with the patient:
- The patient's specific symptoms align well with CLL, and there are no reported symptoms that are inconsistent with this diagnosis.

+2 Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL):
MCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that arises from cells originating in the ""mantle zone"" of the lymph node and typically affects older adults. It is characterized by a rapid progression after a relatively indolent onset.

Common symptoms with the patient:
- Fatigue
- Weight loss
- Night sweats
- Enlargement of the lymph nodes
- Swelling in the spleen
- High white blood cell count

Symptoms not in common with the patient:
- The rapid progression of symptoms is typical for MCL, which may not align with the patient's slow progression over six months.

+3 Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM):
WM is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the presence of large numbers of abnormal white blood cells that produce a protein called monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM). This can lead to symptoms such as bleeding, vision problems, and neurological symptoms.

Common symptoms with the patient:
- Fatigue
- Weight loss
- Frequent infections
- Night sweats
- Feeling of fullness in the abdomen
- Enlargement of the lymph nodes
- Swelling in the spleen

Symptoms not in common with the patient:
- The presence of IgM-related symptoms such as bleeding, vision problems, and neurological symptoms are not reported in the patient.

+4 Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS):
MDS are a group of disorders caused by poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells. Patients with MDS can have symptoms due to anemia, infection, and bleeding as the bone marrow fails to produce enough healthy cells.

Common symptoms with the patient:
- Fatigue
- Weight loss
- Frequent infections

Symptoms not in common with the patient:
- MDS typically presents with symptoms related to anemia, such as shortness of breath and pallor, which are not specified in the patient's presentation.

+5 Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL):
HCL is a rare, slow-growing cancer of the blood in which your bone marrow makes too many B cells (lymphocytes), a type of white blood cell that fights infection. These excess B cells are abnormal and look ""hairy"" under a microscope.

Common symptoms with the patient:
- Fatigue
- Weight loss
- Frequent infections
- Feeling of fullness in the abdomen
- Enlargement of the lymph nodes
- Swelling in the spleen
- High white blood cell count

Symptoms not in common with the patient:
- The ""hairy"" appearance of the B cells is a specific diagnostic feature that would need to be confirmed with a microscopic examination of the blood or bone marrow.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely diagnosis from this list appears to be Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), but further diagnostic tests, such as flow cytometry, immunophenotyping, and possibly a bone marrow biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Hidrocefalia congénita,"+1 Hydrocephalus:
Hydrocephalus is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure. This can cause a larger head circumference, fullness of the fontanelle, and the ""sunset sign"" due to pressure on the upward gaze muscles. Symptoms in common with the patient: larger head circumference, widening of cranial sutures, fullness of the fontanelle, irritability, high-pitched crying, feeding difficulties, ""sunset sign,"" and slow developmental milestones. Symptoms not in common: The patient's history of maternal infection during pregnancy is not a typical cause of hydrocephalus, but it could be a contributing factor if it led to an in-utero condition affecting brain development.

+2 Congenital Infection:
Congenital infections, such as those caused by the TORCH complex (Toxoplasmosis, Other agents, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus), can lead to various neurological and developmental issues in infants. These infections can cause inflammation and damage to the infant's brain, potentially leading to an enlarged head and developmental delays. Symptoms in common with the patient: maternal infection during the first trimester, irritability, slow developmental milestones. Symptoms not in common: The specific symptoms of a larger head circumference, widening of cranial sutures, fullness of the fontanelle, and ""sunset sign"" are not exclusive to congenital infections and would require further investigation to link them to a specific infectious cause.

+3 Craniosynostosis:
Craniosynostosis is a rare condition where one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant's skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone, thereby changing the growth pattern of the skull. This can lead to an abnormal head shape and potentially increased intracranial pressure. Symptoms in common with the patient: larger head circumference, widening of cranial sutures. Symptoms not in common: Craniosynostosis typically does not present with a full fontanelle, as the sutures are fused rather than widened. Additionally, the ""sunset sign,"" irritability, and feeding difficulties are not hallmark symptoms of craniosynostosis.

+4 Benign External Hydrocephalus:
Benign external hydrocephalus is a condition where there is an accumulation of CSF in the subarachnoid space, particularly over the frontal lobes, without an increase in intracranial pressure. It is often self-limiting and may resolve on its own. Symptoms in common with the patient: larger head circumference, fullness of the fontanelle, slow developmental milestones. Symptoms not in common: The ""sunset sign"" and irritability are less commonly associated with benign external hydrocephalus, and the widening of cranial sutures is not a typical feature.

+5 Glutaric Acidemia Type I:
Glutaric Acidemia Type I is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the body's inability to properly break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan. This can lead to an accumulation of glutaric acid and related compounds in the body, which can cause brain damage and an enlarged head. Symptoms in common with the patient: larger head circumference, irritability, feeding difficulties, slow developmental milestones. Symptoms not in common: The ""sunset sign"" and widening of cranial sutures are not specific to Glutaric Acidemia Type I, and the fullness of the fontanelle is not a typical symptom.

Given the symptoms presented, it is important to conduct further diagnostic tests, such as imaging studies (e.g., MRI or CT scan), metabolic screenings, and possibly genetic testing, to narrow down the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan."
Enterocolitis necrotizante,"+1 Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC):
Common Symptoms with the Patient: Prematurity, low birth weight, respiratory distress syndrome, feeding intolerance, abdominal distention, lethargy, bloody stools, tender and distended abdomen, elevated temperature, signs of apnea and bradycardia, pneumatosis intestinalis, deterioration despite antibiotics.
Uncommon Symptoms with the Patient: None reported.

+2 Sepsis in Neonates:
Common Symptoms with the Patient: Prematurity, low birth weight, respiratory distress syndrome, lethargy, elevated temperature, signs of apnea and bradycardia.
Uncommon Symptoms with the Patient: Specific signs of infection other than those mentioned, such as a confirmed pathogen.

+3 Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia:
Common Symptoms with the Patient: Respiratory distress syndrome, signs of apnea and bradycardia.
Uncommon Symptoms with the Patient: Abdominal distention, feeding intolerance, bloody stools, pneumatosis intestinalis, and the specific finding of a diaphragmatic defect on imaging.

+4 Hirschsprung Disease:
Common Symptoms with the Patient: Feeding intolerance, abdominal distention, lethargy.
Uncommon Symptoms with the Patient: Bloody stools, signs of apnea and bradycardia, pneumatosis intestinalis, and the absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel, which is a hallmark of Hirschsprung disease.

+5 Intestinal Malrotation with Volvulus:
Common Symptoms with the Patient: Feeding intolerance, abdominal distention, bloody stools, lethargy.
Uncommon Symptoms with the Patient: The specific finding of malrotation and volvulus on imaging, which typically presents with a surgical emergency requiring immediate intervention.

+6 Inborn Errors of Metabolism:
Common Symptoms with the Patient: Lethargy, feeding intolerance.
Uncommon Symptoms with the Patient: Specific metabolic derangements, such as abnormal ammonia or lactate levels, which are not mentioned.

+7 Congenital Heart Disease:
Common Symptoms with the Patient: Respiratory distress syndrome, signs of apnea and bradycardia.
Uncommon Symptoms with the Patient: Specific cardiac anomalies on imaging, feeding intolerance, abdominal distention, bloody stools, and pneumatosis intestinalis.

Given the symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), which is a serious gastrointestinal problem that affects mostly the intestine of premature infants. The presence of pneumatosis intestinalis, which is air within the wall of the intestines, is particularly indicative of NEC. This condition can lead to further complications and requires immediate medical intervention."
Preeclampsia,"+1 Preeclampsia:
Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. It usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal. The symptoms in common with the patient group include sudden increase in blood pressure, swelling in hands and face, rapid weight gain due to increased bodily fluid, and presence of protein in their urine. Some of the women's reports of severe headaches, changes in vision, and upper abdominal pain are also consistent with preeclampsia. Symptoms not in common with the proposed disease have not been mentioned, as the described symptoms align well with preeclampsia.

+2 HELLP Syndrome:
HELLP syndrome is a life-threatening pregnancy complication usually considered to be a variant of preeclampsia. It involves hemolysis (the breaking down of red blood cells), elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. Symptoms in common with the patient group include high blood pressure, swelling, and upper abdominal pain. However, the specific symptoms of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count are not mentioned in the patient group's symptoms. Additionally, not all women with preeclampsia develop HELLP syndrome.

+3 Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP):
AFLP is a rare but serious complication of pregnancy that occurs in the third trimester or early postpartum period. It is characterized by the rapid accumulation of fat in the liver, which can lead to liver damage. Symptoms in common with the patient group include sudden increase in blood pressure, presence of protein in their urine, and upper abdominal pain. However, the specific symptoms of jaundice, nausea and vomiting, and malaise that are often seen in AFLP are not mentioned in the patient group's symptoms.

+4 Eclampsia:
Eclampsia is a severe complication of preeclampsia, involving seizures that occur in a pregnant woman following preeclampsia. Symptoms in common with the patient group include high blood pressure, swelling, rapid weight gain, and presence of protein in their urine. The severe headaches and changes in vision reported by some women could also be premonitory signs of eclampsia. However, the absence of seizures in the patient group's symptoms does not align with a diagnosis of eclampsia.

Given the symptoms presented by the patient group, preeclampsia appears to be the most likely diagnosis. It is important to note that these women require immediate medical attention and management to prevent complications such as eclampsia and HELLP syndrome, which can be life-threatening for both the mother and the baby."
Síndrome de Asherman,"+1 Asherman's Syndrome:
Asherman's syndrome is characterized by the formation of intrauterine adhesions, which can lead to reduced menstrual flow, infertility, and recurrent miscarriages. It is often associated with a history of uterine surgery, such as dilation and curettage. The patient's symptoms of reduced menstrual flow, infertility, and history of multiple dilation and curettage procedures are consistent with Asherman's Syndrome. However, the occasional abdominal pain could be related but is not a definitive symptom of Asherman's Syndrome.

+2 Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) Syndrome:
MRKH syndrome is a disorder that affects the female reproductive system, leading to the underdevelopment of the uterus and vagina. It is typically diagnosed during adolescence when menstruation fails to begin. The patient's history of amenorrhea could suggest MRKH syndrome, but her age and the fact that she has had menstrual cycles and pregnancies, albeit with miscarriages, do not align with the typical presentation of MRKH syndrome.

+3 Premature Ovarian Failure (POF):
POF, also known as premature ovarian insufficiency, is a condition where the ovaries stop functioning properly before the age of 40. It can lead to infertility, amenorrhea, and menopausal symptoms. While the patient has experienced episodes of amenorrhea, her hormonal profile is within the normal range, which is not typical for POF. Additionally, the presence of intrauterine adhesions seen on ultrasound is not a characteristic of POF.

+4 Uterine Fibroids:
Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths of the uterus that can cause a variety of symptoms, including heavy menstrual bleeding, infertility, and pelvic pain. However, the patient presents with reduced menstrual flow, not heavy bleeding, and the ultrasound did not indicate the presence of fibroids. Therefore, this condition is less likely to be the cause of her symptoms.

+5 Endometriosis:
Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterine cavity, causing pain, irregular bleeding, and potentially infertility. While the patient does experience occasional abdominal pain, which could be associated with endometriosis, her primary symptom of reduced menstrual flow and the presence of intrauterine adhesions are not typical of endometriosis.

Given the patient's history and symptoms, Asherman's Syndrome (+1) appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further investigation, including a hysteroscopy, may be necessary to confirm the presence of intrauterine adhesions and to determine the appropriate course of treatment."
Displasia renal,"+1 Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD):
PKD is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. Symptoms that the patient has in common with PKD include persistent lower back pain, frequent urination, blood in urine, high blood pressure, and a familial trend of kidney-related issues. Elevated levels of proteins and creatinine in the blood, fatigue, loss of appetite, and swelling in the hands and feet are also consistent with PKD. However, a significant reduction in urine output is less typical for PKD, as the disease often leads to increased urine production in the earlier stages.

+2 Multiple Myeloma:
Multiple Myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells in the bone marrow. The patient's symptoms that align with multiple myeloma include high blood pressure, elevated levels of proteins (particularly if the proteins are monoclonal proteins or M-proteins), and creatinine in the blood, as well as fatigue and occasional blood in urine. However, multiple myeloma typically presents with bone pain in areas other than the lower back, anemia, and increased susceptibility to infections, which have not been mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+3 Renal Cell Carcinoma:
Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that often begins in the lining of the small tubes in the kidney. The patient's symptoms that match this disease include persistent lower back pain, blood in urine, high blood pressure, and a reduction in urine output. The familial trend of kidney-related issues could also be relevant if there is a hereditary form of renal cell carcinoma in the family. However, renal cell carcinoma does not typically cause elevated levels of proteins in the blood, and the patient's balanced diet and moderate exercise routine are not associated risk factors.

+4 Glomerulonephritis:
Glomerulonephritis is a group of diseases that cause inflammation and damage to the kidney's filtering units, the glomeruli. Symptoms in common with this condition include high blood pressure, elevated levels of proteins and creatinine in the blood, fatigue, and swelling in the hands and feet. The reduction in urine output and the presence of blood in urine are also consistent with glomerulonephritis. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as rashes, joint pain, or other systemic symptoms makes this diagnosis less certain.

+5 Amyloidosis:
Amyloidosis is a rare disease that occurs when a substance called amyloid builds up in the organs. The patient's symptoms that are consistent with amyloidosis include swelling in the hands and feet, fatigue, loss of appetite, and elevated levels of proteins in the blood. The reduction in urine output and the presence of kidney-related issues in the family history could also be relevant. However, amyloidosis often presents with other symptoms such as enlarged tongue, numbness in the hands and feet, or diarrhea, which the patient has not reported.

+6 Goodpasture Syndrome:
Goodpasture Syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that attacks the lungs and kidneys. The patient's symptoms that align with this disease include blood in urine, high blood pressure, and elevated levels of proteins and creatinine in the blood. The presence of kidney-related issues in the family history may also be pertinent if there is an autoimmune trend. However, Goodpasture Syndrome typically includes lung symptoms such as coughing up blood, which the patient has not experienced.

Please note that these are hypothetical considerations based on the provided symptoms, and actual diagnosis should be made by a medical professional through comprehensive clinical evaluation, including physical examination, detailed medical history, and further diagnostic tests as needed."
Linfoma difuso de células B grandes,"'+1' Hodgkin's Lymphoma:
Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates in the lymphatic system. The patient's symptoms of painless swollen lymph nodes, night sweats, fever, and weight loss are common in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The presence of frequent infections and a family history of hematological disorders could also be relevant. However, the patient's healthy lifestyle and non-smoking status are not directly related to the disease. The abnormal white blood cell count could be indicative of Hodgkin's lymphoma, but further diagnostic tests, such as a biopsy of the lymph nodes, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

'+2' Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma:
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a diverse group of blood cancers that include any type of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas. Symptoms such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and fever are consistent with this disease. The patient's frequent infections and abnormal blood test results, including the elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, could also suggest Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The enlarged spleen found upon physical examination is another common sign. The family history of hematological disorders might increase the patient's risk. Further imaging and a lymph node biopsy would be required for a definitive diagnosis.

'+3' Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL):
CLL is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. The disease often presents with swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and an increased susceptibility to infections, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. The abnormal white blood cell count is a hallmark of CLL, and the patient's family history of hematological disorders could be a contributing factor. However, night sweats and weight loss are less commonly associated with CLL, especially in its early stages. Additional tests, such as flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy, would be needed to diagnose CLL.

'+4' Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML):
AML is a fast-growing form of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, fever, and frequent infections could be indicative of AML. The abnormal levels of white blood cells and lactate dehydrogenase in the blood test are also consistent with AML. However, the sudden onset of symptoms and the enlarged spleen are more typical of acute leukemias. The patient's family history may suggest a genetic predisposition. A definitive diagnosis would require a bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic analysis.

'+5' Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS):
MDS are a group of disorders caused by poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and abnormal blood test results, including the high white blood cell count, could be suggestive of MDS. The enlarged spleen and the history of hematological disorders in the family are also potential indicators. However, the swollen lymph nodes are not a typical feature of MDS. A bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic testing would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of MDS.

'+6' Castleman Disease:
Castleman disease is a rare disorder that involves an overgrowth of cells in the body's lymph nodes. The patient's symptoms of swollen lymph nodes, night sweats, and fatigue could be consistent with Castleman disease. The abnormal blood test results and enlarged spleen might also be seen in this condition. However, the frequent infections are not a common symptom of Castleman disease. Diagnosis often requires lymph node biopsy and imaging studies.

'+7' Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis:
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare, Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. It typically presents with lung lesions, but patients may also experience symptoms like fever, night sweats, and weight loss, which the patient has. The swollen lymph nodes and abnormal blood tests could fit this diagnosis, but the lack of respiratory symptoms makes it less likely. A lung biopsy and imaging would be crucial for diagnosis.

For the patient's case, further diagnostic procedures such as imaging studies (CT scans, PET scans), biopsies of the lymph nodes, and possibly bone marrow aspiration and biopsy would be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan."
Trisomía X,"+1 Marfan Syndrome:
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. Patients with Marfan syndrome are typically very tall and thin, with long arms, legs, fingers, and toes. They may also have a variety of skeletal abnormalities such as a high-arched palate, but clinodactyly is not a common feature. Learning difficulties are not a hallmark of this condition, and neither are delayed language and motor skills. Irregular menstrual cycles are not typically associated with Marfan syndrome. The patient's tall stature aligns with this condition, but the absence of other characteristic symptoms such as cardiovascular abnormalities makes this diagnosis less likely.

+2 Turner Syndrome:
Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects females, where one of the X chromosomes is missing or partially missing. It can lead to a variety of symptoms, including short stature, which is not present in this patient. However, Turner syndrome can also cause a high-arched palate and can be associated with learning difficulties and delayed development. It is also known to cause irregular menstrual cycles and premature birth. The patient's learning difficulties, delayed language and motor skills, irregular menstrual cycles, and premature birth align with Turner syndrome, but her tall stature does not.

+3 Klinefelter Syndrome:
Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that affects males, where they have an extra X chromosome (XXY). This condition is characterized by tall stature and can sometimes lead to learning difficulties and delayed language development. However, since the patient is female, this condition can be ruled out.

+4 Fragile X Syndrome:
Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. It is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability in males and can also affect females, though typically to a lesser extent. Physical abnormalities can sometimes be present, but they do not typically include tall stature or the specific skeletal features described in the patient. Delayed language and motor skills, as well as social and behavioral challenges, are common in Fragile X syndrome. The patient's learning difficulties, delayed development, and social awkwardness align with this condition, but the tall stature and physical abnormalities do not.

+5 Triple X Syndrome:
Triple X syndrome, also known as Trisomy X, is a genetic disorder where a female has an extra X chromosome. Women with this condition tend to be taller than average, which aligns with the patient's presentation. They can also have learning disabilities and delayed development of speech and language skills. Menstrual irregularities can occur, and some may have social and emotional difficulties. The patient's tall stature, learning difficulties, delayed language and motor skills, irregular menstrual cycles, and social challenges are consistent with Triple X syndrome. However, the presence of epicanthal folds and clinodactyly are not typical features of this condition.

Given the patient's symptoms, it is important to consider a variety of potential diagnoses, including chromosomal disorders. Further genetic testing and evaluation by a specialist in genetics may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis."
Esclerodermia,"+1 Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma):
Systemic sclerosis is a rare chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis (hardening and tightening) of the skin and internal organs. The patient's symptoms of skin tightening on the hands and face, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, and shortness of breath are consistent with this condition. Raynaud's phenomenon, which is the discoloration of fingers in response to cold or stress, is also a common feature of systemic sclerosis. The patient's heartburn and digestive issues could be related to gastrointestinal involvement, which is often seen in systemic sclerosis. However, without evidence of internal organ involvement, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made solely on these symptoms.

+2 Dermatomyositis:
Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory muscle disease that presents with a distinctive skin rash, muscle weakness, and inflammatory myopathy. While the patient does have skin changes, the lack of muscle weakness and the absence of the typical rash make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's symptoms do not fully align with dermatomyositis, as there is no mention of muscle pain or weakness, which are key features of this disease.

+3 Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD):
MCTD is a rare autoimmune disorder that may present with features of systemic sclerosis, lupus, and polymyositis. The patient's symptoms of skin tightening, Raynaud's phenomenon, and difficulty swallowing could be seen in MCTD. Fatigue and shortness of breath are also common. However, MCTD typically includes more specific symptoms such as swollen hands or joint pain, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+4 CREST Syndrome:
CREST syndrome is a limited form of systemic sclerosis characterized by Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyly (thickening and tightening of the skin on the fingers and toes), and Telangiectasia. The patient's symptoms of skin tightening, Raynaud's phenomenon, and difficulty swallowing align with CREST syndrome. However, the absence of calcinosis and telangiectasia in the patient's description makes this diagnosis less certain.

+5 Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC):
PBC is a chronic liver disease characterized by the destruction of bile ducts, leading to liver damage. While the patient does report digestive issues, the primary symptoms of PBC include itching, jaundice, and fatigue, which are not prominently described in the patient's case. The skin changes and Raynaud's phenomenon are not typical features of PBC, making this diagnosis unlikely based on the current symptoms.

+6 Eosinophilic Fasciitis:
Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare condition that causes inflammation and thickening of the fascia, the connective tissue beneath the skin. The patient's symptoms of skin tightening could suggest this condition. However, eosinophilic fasciitis typically presents with rapid onset of swelling and pain, often following physical exertion, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Additionally, the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon is not a characteristic of this disease.

Given the patient's symptoms, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) or a related connective tissue disease seems to be the most likely diagnosis. Further investigations, including blood tests for specific autoantibodies, imaging studies, and possibly a skin biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of internal organ involvement."
Hidrops fetal no inmunológico,"+1 Hydrops Fetalis:
Hydrops fetalis is a serious condition in which abnormal amounts of fluid build up in two or more body areas of a fetus or newborn. This can be a symptom of a variety of diseases and conditions. In this case, the fetus shows signs of fluid accumulation in the skin (edema), lungs (pleural effusion), abdomen (ascites), and around the heart (pericardial effusion), which are consistent with hydrops fetalis. The presence of anemia and cardiovascular complications also align with this condition. However, hydrops fetalis is not a disease itself but a symptom of underlying issues, which can include cardiovascular defects, chromosomal abnormalities, or infections, none of which have been identified in this patient.

+2 Noonan Syndrome:
Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including congenital heart defects and distinctive facial features. Fluid accumulation can occur, but it is not typically as widespread as seen in this patient. The fetus does not exhibit the characteristic facial features associated with Noonan syndrome, and there is no family history of genetic disorders. Additionally, Noonan syndrome is usually associated with specific genetic mutations, which have not been identified in this case.

+3 Congenital Chylothorax:
Congenital chylothorax is a rare condition where lymphatic fluid accumulates in the pleural cavity of the fetus, which can lead to hydrops. The fetus has fluid accumulation in the lungs, which is consistent with this condition. However, congenital chylothorax typically does not cause fluid accumulation in the skin or abdomen, nor does it typically result in anemia or cardiovascular complications without the presence of other anomalies or syndromes.

+4 Cardiovascular Anomaly:
A cardiovascular anomaly could explain the fluid accumulation in the heart and possibly the anemia and cardiovascular complications observed. However, this diagnosis would not account for the fluid accumulation in the skin, lungs, and abdomen unless there is a significant heart failure or other underlying conditions that have not been detected.

+5 Hemoglobinopathy:
Hemoglobinopathies are inherited disorders affecting the structure or production of hemoglobin. They can lead to anemia and hydrops fetalis. The fetus's signs of anemia could suggest a hemoglobinopathy. However, without a family history or genetic testing indicating such a disorder, and given the lack of other common symptoms of hemoglobinopathies, this diagnosis may not fully explain all the observed symptoms.

+6 Parvovirus B19 Infection:
Parvovirus B19 can cause fetal anemia and non-immune hydrops fetalis. However, the mother has no history of infectious disease during this pregnancy, and all immunological tests have come back negative, which makes this diagnosis less likely.

+7 Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS):
TTTS is a condition that occurs in pregnancies with identical twins where blood from one twin is transferred to the other. It can lead to hydrops in the recipient twin. However, this diagnosis is not applicable as there is no indication that the pregnancy involves twins.

Given the symptoms and the information provided, the most likely diagnosis to consider would be hydrops fetalis, but further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause. This would typically involve a detailed ultrasound to look for structural abnormalities, echocardiogram to assess cardiac function, and possibly DNA testing for genetic conditions. It is crucial to work closely with a multidisciplinary team, including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, to manage the pregnancy and plan for the delivery and care of the newborn."
Carcinoma de células renales,"+1 Von Hippel-Lindau disease:
Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a hereditary condition associated with tumors arising in multiple organs. Symptoms can include hemangioblastomas (blood vessel tumors in the brain, spinal cord, and eye), renal cysts, and renal cell carcinoma. Patients may also have pheochromocytomas, which are tumors of the adrenal gland.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Solid mass in the kidney (possible renal cell carcinoma)
- Multiple nodules in the lungs (possible metastases or additional tumors)

Uncommon Symptoms with Patient:
- No mention of hemangioblastomas or pheochromocytomas
- No family history provided to suggest hereditary condition

+2 Paraneoplastic syndrome:
Paraneoplastic syndromes are a group of rare disorders that are triggered by an abnormal immune system response to a neoplasm.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- History of smoking and hypertension (risk factors)
- Fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and persistent lower back pain
- Solid mass in the left kidney
- Elevated liver enzymes (possible metastasis)
- Multiple lung nodules (possible metastasis)

Uncommon Symptoms with Patient:
- No specific symptoms such as hematuria (blood in urine) mentioned

+4 Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome:
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to skin lesions, lung cysts, and renal tumors. It is caused by mutations in the FLCN gene.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Solid mass in the kidney (possible renal tumor)
- Multiple lung nodules (could be related to lung cysts)

Uncommon Symptoms with Patient:
- No mention of skin lesions
- No genetic testing results provided to confirm FLCN mutation

+5 Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1):
MEN1 is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by tumors in multiple endocrine glands, including the parathyroid (which can cause elevated blood calcium levels), pancreas, and pituitary gland. Non-endocrine tumors, such as carcinoid tumors and adrenal adenomas, can also occur.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Slightly high blood calcium level (possible hyperparathyroidism)

Uncommon Symptoms with Patient:
- No mention of tumors in endocrine glands other than the potential for parathyroid involvement
- No family history provided to suggest hereditary condition

Given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis from this list appears to be renal cell carcinoma (RCC), especially considering the risk factors, the presence of a solid mass in the kidney, and the multiple lung nodules which could represent metastatic disease. Further diagnostic workup, including a biopsy of the renal mass and possibly the lung nodules, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other potential rare diseases."
Neuropatía periférica genética,"+1 Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT):
CMT is a group of inherited disorders that affect the peripheral nerves. Symptoms in common with the patient include progressive muscle weakness, particularly in the lower extremities, and a loss of sensation in the extremities. The patient's familial history is also consistent with CMT, as it often runs in families. Decreased reflexes and loss of proprioception are also symptoms of CMT. However, the patient does not mention other common symptoms such as high arches or hammertoes.

+2 Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy (HSAN):
HSAN encompasses a group of rare genetic nerve disorders. Symptoms in common with the patient include a gradual loss of sensation and muscle weakness in the extremities, as well as a familial history of similar symptoms. The sharp, burning pain in the feet and the instability of gait are also consistent with some types of HSAN. However, the patient does not report other symptoms such as ulcers or injuries to the extremities that go unnoticed, which are often associated with HSAN.

+3 Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP):
FAP is a rare inherited disease that leads to the buildup of amyloid proteins in the body's organs and tissues. Symptoms in common with the patient include progressive muscle weakness, loss of sensation, and autonomic dysfunction, which could explain the sharp, burning pain. The familial history and age of onset are also consistent with FAP. However, the patient does not mention other symptoms such as gastrointestinal disturbances or cardiac issues, which are often seen in FAP.

+4 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 4:
SMA Type 4 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy, typically presenting in adulthood. Symptoms in common with the patient include progressive muscle weakness in the lower extremities and frequent falls due to instability. However, SMA Type 4 does not typically involve sensory deficits or sharp, burning pain, which the patient experiences.

+5 Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP):
HSP is a group of inherited disorders that primarily affect the lower extremities, leading to spasticity and weakness. Symptoms in common with the patient include progressive muscle weakness in the lower extremities and an unstable gait. The familial history is also consistent with HSP. However, the patient does not report the characteristic spasticity, and HSP typically does not involve a loss of sensation or decreased reflexes.

Given the patient's symptoms and familial history, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) and Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) seem to be the most likely diagnoses. Further genetic testing and possibly nerve conduction studies or a nerve biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."

Symptoms the patient does not have in common: Enlarged lymph nodes, high levels of IgM antibodies, and vision changes due to hyperviscosity of the blood.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, further diagnostic tests such as a biopsy to identify the type of amyloid protein, genetic testing for hereditary amyloidosis, and bone marrow examination for multiple myeloma would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and tailor the treatment accordingly."
Hepatitis delta,"+1 Wilson's Disease:
Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. Symptoms can include jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain, which could correlate with the patient's general malaise, fatigue, and jaundice. Hepatomegaly is also a common finding in Wilson's disease. However, the patient's history of intravenous drug use and unprotected intercourse might suggest a different etiology for his symptoms. Elevated liver enzymes are consistent with Wilson's disease, but the decrease in serum albumin could be due to various causes. The patient's prior blood-borne viral infection and vaccination history may be more indicative of a different liver condition.

+2 Hepatitis C:
Hepatitis C is a blood-borne viral infection that affects the liver and can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, jaundice, and abdominal pain. The patient's history of intravenous drug use and unprotected intercourse are significant risk factors for Hepatitis C. Elevated liver enzymes and decreased serum albumin are also consistent with this disease. The patient's prior diagnosis of a blood-borne viral infection could be related to Hepatitis C, and the fact that he was vaccinated for a similar condition suggests that he may not have been vaccinated for Hepatitis C specifically, as there is no widely available vaccine for it.

+3 Hemochromatosis:
Hemochromatosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron is then deposited in various organs, particularly the liver, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly, which the patient exhibits. However, jaundice is not typically an early symptom of hemochromatosis, and the patient's lifestyle risk factors and prior blood-borne viral infection may point to a different diagnosis.

+4 Autoimmune Hepatitis:
Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease in which the body's immune system attacks the liver, causing inflammation and damage. Symptoms can include fatigue, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes, all of which the patient has. However, the patient's history of intravenous drug use, unprotected intercourse, and travel to endemic regions might suggest an infectious cause rather than an autoimmune one.

+5 Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC):
Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic disease that slowly destroys the bile ducts in the liver. Symptoms can include fatigue, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes, which align with the patient's presentation. However, PBC is more common in middle-aged women and does not typically present with vomiting or a history of intravenous drug use, making it less likely in this patient's case.

+6 Alcoholic Liver Disease:
Alcoholic liver disease is damage to the liver and its function due to alcohol abuse. The patient's symptoms of jaundice, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes could be indicative of this condition. However, there is no mention of alcohol use in the patient's history, and the other risk factors such as intravenous drug use and unprotected intercourse suggest a different etiology.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, Hepatitis C seems to be the most likely diagnosis, but further testing, including specific serologies and possibly a liver biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."

+4 Congenital Syphilis:
This is a bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum, which can be transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus. Symptoms that match: Hepatosplenomegaly, intrauterine growth retardation, and the non-specific febrile illness of the mother could be indicative of syphilis. Symptoms that do not match: Congenital syphilis often presents with other signs such as skeletal abnormalities and rash, which are not mentioned here.

+5 Congenital Rubella Syndrome:
Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can lead to congenital rubella syndrome in the fetus. Symptoms that match: Microcephaly, intrauterine growth retardation, and the mother's febrile illness during the first trimester could be consistent with rubella. Symptoms that do not match: Congenital rubella syndrome often includes cataracts or heart defects, which are not reported here.

+6 Parvovirus B19 Infection (Fifth Disease):
Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy can lead to severe anemia in the fetus and non-immune hydrops fetalis. Symptoms that match: The increased amount of amniotic fluid could be related to hydrops fetalis, and the mother's illness could be due to parvovirus B19. Symptoms that do not match: The typical findings of severe anemia and specific blood test results for parvovirus B19 are not mentioned.

Given the symptoms presented, it is important to conduct specific tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as PCR testing for viral DNA or serological testing for the presence of specific antibodies in the amniotic fluid or fetal blood. Additionally, a detailed ultrasound and possibly MRI could provide more information about the structural abnormalities and help narrow down the diagnosis. Genetic testing might also be considered to rule out inherited conditions."
Síndrome de Romano-Ward,"+1 Long QT Syndrome (LQTS):
Long QT Syndrome is a heart rhythm disorder that can cause fast, chaotic heartbeats, potentially leading to fainting, seizures, or sudden death.

Please note that these are potential rare diseases based on the symptoms provided, and further diagnostic tests such as imaging, genetic testing, and possibly a kidney biopsy would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis. It is also important to consider more common conditions that could present with similar symptoms."
Estenosis valvular pulmonar congénita,"+1 Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS):
This is a rare congenital heart defect where the left side of the heart is underdeveloped. It affects normal blood flow through the heart. Symptoms that match include rapid breathing, excessive fatigue, poor weight gain, and signs of failure to thrive. The presence of a heart murmur and a family history of congenital heart defects also align with this condition. The bluish discoloration of the skin (cyanosis) is consistent with the oxygen deficiency seen in HLHS. Symptoms not mentioned that could also be present in HLHS include cold extremities and lethargy.

+2 Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF):
TOF is a rare condition caused by a combination of four heart defects that are present at birth. These defects affect the structure of the heart and cause oxygen-poor blood to flow out of the heart and into the rest of the body. Symptoms in common with the patient's presentation include a heart murmur, bluish skin discoloration, rapid breathing, and poor weight gain. The family history of congenital heart defects is also a relevant factor. Symptoms not in common might include episodes of very low oxygen levels (tet spells) or a boot-shaped heart on a chest X-ray, which were not mentioned.

+3 Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA):
In TGA, the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed, which causes serious problems with the flow of oxygen to the body. The patient's symptoms of rapid breathing, cyanosis, and heart murmur are consistent with TGA. The excessive fatigue and failure to thrive could also be related to this condition. The family history of congenital heart defects is a risk factor. Symptoms not in common that might be expected include difficulty feeding and shortness of breath, which are not specifically mentioned.

+4 Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR):
TAPVR is a rare heart defect where the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Instead, they connect to another blood vessel or the wrong part of the heart, causing oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix. Symptoms that match the patient's presentation include rapid breathing, poor weight gain, and a heart murmur. The cyanosis and family history of heart defects are also consistent with TAPVR. Symptoms not in common might include specific types of murmurs or signs of pulmonary venous obstruction, which are not detailed here.

However, APMPPE is often associated with flu-like symptoms preceding the eye symptoms, which the patient does not report.

+5 Primary Intraocular Lymphoma:
This is a rare form of cancer that occurs in the eye and can present with symptoms such as eye pain, blurred vision, sensitivity to light, floaters, and vision loss. The patient's symptoms are consistent with primary intraocular lymphoma. However, this condition is usually associated with central nervous system involvement, which the patient has not reported.

+6 Uveitis:
Uveitis is a general term for inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. Symptoms can include eye pain, blurred vision, light sensitivity, floaters, and vision loss. The patient's symptoms are consistent with uveitis. Uveitis can be associated with systemic diseases, but it can also occur in isolation, which may be the case here as the patient is otherwise healthy and has no significant past medical history.

In summary, the patient's symptoms are consistent with several rare diseases that affect the eyes. Further diagnostic tests, including blood tests, imaging, and possibly a referral to an ophthalmologist or rheumatologist, would be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment."
Hipotiroidismo congénito,"+1 Congenital Hypothyroidism:
This is a condition where the thyroid gland is underactive from birth, leading to a deficiency in thyroid hormones. Symptoms in common with the patient include delayed growth, developmental milestones, poor feeding, lethargy, protruding belly, puffy face, thickened features, dry and cool skin, lack of muscle tone, constipation, and a lower than average heart rate. The family history of endocrine system disorders also supports this potential diagnosis.

+2 Pompe Disease:
Pompe disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that leads to the accumulation of glycogen in the body's cells. Symptoms in common with the patient include poor muscle tone, delayed growth, and a protruding belly. However, Pompe disease often presents with progressive muscle weakness, which may not be evident in this patient, and there is no mention of heart enlargement, which is another key symptom of Pompe disease.

+3 Prader-Willi Syndrome:
This genetic disorder is characterized by a constant sense of hunger, leading to obesity, and is associated with reduced muscle tone, developmental delays, and distinctive facial features. Symptoms in common with the patient include poor muscle tone, developmental delays, and a protruding belly. However, the patient does not exhibit an excessive appetite or obesity, which are hallmark symptoms of Prader-Willi Syndrome.

+4 Cushing's Syndrome:
Cushing's syndrome is caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol and can be due to various underlying issues, including adrenal or pituitary tumors. Symptoms in common with the patient include a puffy face and thickened features. However, Cushing's syndrome is also associated with high blood pressure and rapid weight gain, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+5 Myxedema:
This is a severe form of hypothyroidism that can occur in infants and children. Symptoms in common with the patient include delayed growth, developmental milestones, poor feeding, lethargy, protruding belly, puffy face, thickened features, dry and cool skin, lack of muscle tone, and constipation. The family history of endocrine disorders and the low heart rate also align with this potential diagnosis.

+6 Zellweger Syndrome:
A rare congenital disorder characterized by the reduction or absence of peroxisomes in the cells. Symptoms in common with the patient include hypotonia (lack of muscle tone), developmental delays, and a protruding belly. However, Zellweger syndrome typically presents with additional features such as hearing and vision impairments, liver dysfunction, and distinctive facial features, which are not specified in the patient's symptoms.

Given the symptoms and family history, congenital hypothyroidism and myxedema are the most likely diagnoses. Further testing, including thyroid function tests and imaging, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and begin appropriate treatment."
Daño cerebral traumático de moderado a grave,"+1 Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD):
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is a rare, degenerative, invariably fatal brain disorder. It affects about one in every one million people per year worldwide. Symptoms the patient has in common with CJD include confusion, difficulty in speech, and seizures. Neurological symptoms such as poor coordination and impaired cognitive abilities are also consistent with CJD. However, the patient's history of a significant head injury and the pattern of symptoms following this event are not typical for CJD, which usually does not have a clear traumatic trigger.

+2 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):
Traumatic Brain Injury is a result of a blow or jolt to the head that disrupts the normal function of the brain. Symptoms in common with TBI include intermittent episodes of unconsciousness, confusion, difficulty in speech, persistent headaches, frequent vomiting, seizures, poor coordination, slurred speech, and impaired cognitive abilities. The unevenly dilated pupils and varying motor responses are also indicative of TBI. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a moderate to severe TBI following a motor vehicle accident.

+3 Subdural Hematoma:
A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood outside the brain, usually caused by severe head injuries. Symptoms that match the patient's condition include intermittent episodes of unconsciousness, confusion, persistent headaches, vomiting, and seizures. Neurological signs such as poor coordination, slurred speech, and impaired cognitive abilities are also common in subdural hematoma. The uneven dilation of pupils could suggest increased intracranial pressure due to the hematoma. The patient's symptoms following a head injury are consistent with this diagnosis.

+4 Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI):
Diffuse Axonal Injury is a form of traumatic brain injury that occurs when the brain rapidly shifts inside the skull as an injury is sustained. Symptoms in common with DAI include confusion, difficulty in speech, seizures, and impaired cognitive abilities. The patient's varying motor responses and the fact that he is mostly conscious and oriented are also seen in DAI. However, the presence of frequent vomiting and the specific pupil dilation observed are not typical symptoms of DAI.

+5 Cerebral Contusion:
A cerebral contusion is a bruise of the brain tissue, often associated with traumatic brain injuries. Symptoms that align with the patient's condition include confusion, difficulty in speech, persistent headaches, and seizures. The patient's neurological examination results, such as poor coordination and slurred speech, are also indicative of a cerebral contusion. The unevenly dilated pupils could be a sign of localized brain damage associated with a contusion. The patient's history of a head injury is consistent with this diagnosis.

+6 Meningitis:
Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. While some symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and vomiting could be seen in meningitis, the patient's history of a head injury and the pattern of neurological deficits are not typical for meningitis. Additionally, the patient's intermittent episodes of unconsciousness and unevenly dilated pupils are not common symptoms of meningitis.

+7 Encephalitis:
Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain often caused by an infection. The patient's symptoms of confusion, seizures, and impaired cognitive abilities could be seen in encephalitis. However, the patient's recent head injury and the specific pattern of symptoms, including uneven pupil dilation and persistent headaches, are not characteristic of encephalitis, which is typically associated with infectious causes rather than trauma.

Given the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is a form of traumatic brain injury, such as a subdural hematoma or a severe contusion. Further imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to guide treatment."
Síndrome de deleción 22q11.2,"+1 DiGeorge Syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome):
This genetic disorder is characterized by congenital heart defects, palatal abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and learning difficulties, which align with the symptoms you've described. Patients with DiGeorge Syndrome may also have immune system problems, leading to increased susceptibility to infections.

+2 Velocardiofacial Syndrome:
This syndrome is similar to DiGeorge Syndrome and is often considered a variant of it. It includes congenital heart defects, palatal abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and learning difficulties. Immune system problems are also common, as are psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, mood, and anxiety disorders. Cognitive and developmental delays can be present, as well as feeding and growth issues. The variability in symptom severity is also consistent with this syndrome.

+3 Williams Syndrome:
Williams Syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features, congenital heart defects, and learning difficulties. Individuals with this syndrome often have a very sociable personality, which is not mentioned in your sample. They may also have mild to moderate cognitive and developmental delays. However, Williams Syndrome does not typically include immune system problems or a high prevalence of schizophrenia, which may not align with the symptoms in your sample.

+4 Noonan Syndrome:
Noonan Syndrome includes congenital heart defects, distinctive facial features, and learning difficulties. Some individuals may have feeding issues and growth delays. Cognitive and developmental delays can vary in severity. However, Noonan Syndrome does not typically involve palatal abnormalities or a significantly increased risk of psychiatric disorders, which may not align with the symptoms in your sample.

+5 22q11.2 Duplication Syndrome:
This syndrome can present with congenital heart defects, learning difficulties, and distinctive facial features. Some individuals may have immune system problems and developmental delays. However, the presence of palatal abnormalities and the specific spectrum of mental health disorders seen in your sample may not be as commonly associated with this syndrome.

+6 Fragile X Syndrome:
Fragile X Syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. Some individuals with Fragile X may have distinctive facial features and issues with feeding and growth. However, congenital heart defects and palatal abnormalities are not typical features of this syndrome, and immune system problems are not commonly reported, which may not align with the symptoms in your sample.

Please note that these are potential rare diseases that could match the symptoms described, but a thorough clinical evaluation, genetic testing, and consultation with specialists are necessary to reach an accurate diagnosis."
Hipotiroidismo primario congénito,"+1 Crigler-Najjar syndrome:
Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder affecting the metabolism of bilirubin, a substance made by the liver. Infants with this condition often present with severe jaundice. However, symptoms such as difficulty feeding, a hoarse cry, slow growth, a large protruding tongue, an umbilical hernia, a distended abdomen, and dry, cool skin are not typically associated with Crigler-Najjar syndrome.

+2 Congenital Hypothyroidism:
Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition present at birth where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms include prolonged jaundice, difficulty feeding, lethargy (lack of energy), a hoarse cry, slow growth, a large protruding tongue, and an umbilical hernia. The distended abdomen and dry, cool skin could also be related to the overall slowed metabolism caused by hypothyroidism. This condition could explain many of the symptoms the infant is experiencing.

+3 Prader-Willi Syndrome:
Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic condition that affects many parts of the body. Infants with this syndrome often have poor muscle tone, feeding difficulties, and slow growth. However, prolonged jaundice is not a common symptom of Prader-Willi syndrome. Additionally, a hoarse cry, a large protruding tongue, an umbilical hernia, a distended abdomen, and dry, cool skin are not typical features of this condition.

+4 Zellweger Spectrum Disorder:
Zellweger spectrum disorder is a group of rare congenital disorders characterized by the reduction or absence of peroxisomes in the cells. Infants with this disorder may exhibit hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and growth retardation. Jaundice can occur, but it is not usually prolonged. A large protruding tongue, an umbilical hernia, and a distended abdomen are not characteristic symptoms of Zellweger spectrum disorder. Dry, cool skin is also not a typical symptom.

+5 Pompe Disease:
Pompe disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that leads to the accumulation of glycogen in the body's cells. It can cause muscle weakness, poor muscle tone, and feeding difficulties. Growth retardation can also be a feature. However, prolonged jaundice, a hoarse cry, a large protruding tongue, an umbilical hernia, a distended abdomen, and dry, cool skin are not commonly associated with Pompe disease.

+6 Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome:
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is an overgrowth disorder usually present at birth, characterized by an increased risk of childhood cancer and certain congenital features. Symptoms can include an umbilical hernia, a large protruding tongue, and a distended abdomen. However, prolonged jaundice, difficulty feeding, a hoarse cry, slow growth, and dry, cool skin are not typical symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.

Given the symptoms presented, congenital hypothyroidism (+2) seems to be the most likely diagnosis, as it accounts for the majority of the symptoms observed in the patient. However, further diagnostic tests, including blood tests to measure thyroid hormone levels and liver function, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. Genetic testing may also be considered, given the lack of family history for these symptoms."
Linfoma folicular,"+1 Hodgkin's Lymphoma:
Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates in the lymphatic system. It is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in lymph nodes. Symptoms often include painless swelling of lymph nodes, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats, which align with the patient's presentation. However, the absence of other symptoms such as fever, itching, or a cough does not rule out the disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as a biopsy of the lymph nodes and imaging studies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

+2 Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma:
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a diverse group of blood cancers that include any type of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphoma. Symptoms can be similar to those of Hodgkin's lymphoma, including painless lymph node swelling, weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats. The patient's symptoms and family history of hematological disorders could suggest this condition. Additional symptoms not reported by the patient, such as chest pain or difficulty breathing, may also occur in some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Diagnostic tests similar to those for Hodgkin's lymphoma would be required.

+3 Castleman Disease:
Castleman disease is a rare disorder that involves an overgrowth of cells in the body's lymph nodes. Symptoms can include enlarged lymph nodes, weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms. However, the patient does not report associated symptoms such as fever, anemia, or skin rashes. Diagnosis is typically made through lymph node biopsy and laboratory tests.

+4 Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis:
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare, Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. It typically presents with lung involvement, but patients may also experience lymph node enlargement, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue. The patient's symptoms of lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and night sweats could suggest this disease, although the lack of respiratory symptoms or neurological signs makes it less likely. Imaging of the chest and a biopsy would be helpful in diagnosis.

+5 Sarcoidosis:
Sarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small clumps of inflammatory cells, in various organs. Symptoms can include swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and weight loss. Night sweats are less common but can occur. The patient's symptoms of lymphadenopathy and systemic signs are consistent with sarcoidosis, but the absence of other common symptoms such as shortness of breath, skin lesions, or eye inflammation does not confirm the diagnosis. Chest imaging and possibly a biopsy of the affected lymph nodes would be necessary for diagnosis.

+6 Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma:
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It often presents with generalized lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms like fever, weight loss, night sweats, and a rash. The patient's symptoms of lymph node swelling, weight loss, and night sweats could be indicative of this disease, although the absence of fever and rash noted in the patient's history would require further investigation. Diagnosis is confirmed through lymph node biopsy and additional laboratory tests.

For each of these potential rare diseases, the patient's symptoms match some but not all of the typical clinical presentations. To reach a definitive diagnosis, further investigations including blood tests, imaging studies, and biopsies would be necessary. It is also important to consider more common conditions that could present with similar symptoms before concluding a rare disease diagnosis."
Fiebre hemorrágica con síndrome renal,"+1 Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS):
Common Symptoms: Sudden onset of severe headache, high fever, chills, and decreased urine output are consistent with HPS, which can be contracted through contact with rodent carriers, often in rural areas.
Non-Common Symptoms: The patient does not exhibit respiratory symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath, which are typical for HPS.

+2 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP):
Common Symptoms: Thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, fever, and neurological symptoms such as blurred vision could suggest TTP, a rare blood disorder.
Non-Common Symptoms: TTP is less commonly associated with back and abdominal pain or a flushed face.

+3 Leptospirosis:
Common Symptoms: High fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting (nausea), and jaundice can occur in leptospirosis, which is often contracted through water contaminated by infected animal urine, possibly linked to the patient's outdoor activities.
Non-Common Symptoms: The patient does not mention jaundice or muscle aches, which are common in leptospirosis.

+4 Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF):
Common Symptoms: Severe headache, high fever, abdominal pain, and thrombocytopenia are symptoms of RMSF, a tick-borne illness that could be related to the patient's history of outdoor activities.
Non-Common Symptoms: The patient does not report a rash, which is a hallmark sign of RMSF.

+5 Weil's Disease (Severe Leptospirosis):
Common Symptoms: High fever, headache, chills, nausea, low urine output, and thrombocytopenia are consistent with Weil's disease, a severe form of leptospirosis.
Non-Common Symptoms: The patient does not report jaundice or muscle aches, which are also symptoms of Weil's disease.

+6 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS):
Common Symptoms: Thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and low urine output are indicative of HUS, which can follow certain infections or be idiopathic.
Non-Common Symptoms: HUS typically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, which the patient does not report.

+7 Meningococcemia:
Common Symptoms: Sudden onset of severe headache, high fever, nausea, and a rapid heart rate could suggest meningococcemia, a severe infection of the bloodstream.
Non-Common Symptoms: The patient does not exhibit a petechial rash or neck stiffness, which are commonly associated with meningococcemia.

+8 Ehrlichiosis:
Common Symptoms: Symptoms such as headache, muscle aches, and thrombocytopenia could be due to ehrlichiosis, another tick-borne disease.
Non-Common Symptoms: The patient does not report a rash or muscle aches, which are often seen in ehrlichiosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, further diagnostic tests such as serology for hantavirus, leptospirosis, and tick-borne diseases, as well as additional imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture, may be warranted to narrow down the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment."
Carcinoma no papilar de células transicionales de la vejiga,"+1 Bladder Cancer:
Bladder cancer could be a potential diagnosis for this patient. The symptoms of frequent urination, pain during urination, and occasional hematuria are common in bladder cancer. The patient's history of smoking and exposure to chemicals in the industry are significant risk factors for bladder cancer. The unexplained weight loss and lower abdominal pain could also be associated with this disease. However, without further diagnostic tests such as cystoscopy, urine cytology, or imaging studies, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed.

Common Symptoms with Proposed Disease:
- Frequent urination
- Pain during urination
- Occasional hematuria
- Unexplained weight loss
- Lower abdominal pain

Symptoms Not Common with Proposed Disease:
- None identified at this stage without further diagnostic information

+2 Prostate Cancer:
Prostate cancer is another possible diagnosis, especially considering the patient's age and symptoms. While frequent urination and lower abdominal pain are symptoms of prostate cancer, hematuria is less common but still possible. The patient's family history and long-term smoking are risk factors. A digital rectal exam and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test would be necessary to further evaluate this possibility.

Common Symptoms with Proposed Disease:
- Frequent urination
- Lower abdominal pain

Symptoms Not Common with Proposed Disease:
- Pain during urination is less typical for prostate cancer
- Occasional hematuria is less common but possible

+3 Renal Cell Carcinoma:
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a type of kidney cancer that could present with hematuria and unexplained weight loss. Pain can occur but is not always present. The patient's smoking history and chemical exposure are risk factors for RCC. Imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI are needed to evaluate the kidneys.

Common Symptoms with Proposed Disease:
- Occasional hematuria
- Unexplained weight loss

Symptoms Not Common with Proposed Disease:
- Frequent urination and pain during urination are not typical initial symptoms of RCC

+4 Urothelial Carcinoma (Upper Urinary Tract):
Urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract can present with hematuria and pain during urination. The patient's risk factors and symptoms could align with this diagnosis. However, frequent urination is more commonly associated with bladder involvement. Imaging and endoscopic evaluation would be necessary.

Common Symptoms with Proposed Disease:
- Pain during urination
- Occasional hematuria

Symptoms Not Common with Proposed Disease:
- Frequent urination is not as common unless the bladder is involved

+5 Interstitial Cystitis:
Although not a cancer, interstitial cystitis is a chronic condition that can cause frequent urination, pain during urination, and tenderness in the lower abdominal region. It is less likely to cause hematuria or weight loss. It is more common in women but can occur in men.

Common Symptoms with Proposed Disease:
- Frequent urination
- Pain during urination
- Lower abdominal pain

Symptoms Not Common with Proposed Disease:
- Occasional hematuria
- Unexplained weight loss is not typical of interstitial cystitis

Further diagnostic tests are crucial to narrow down the diagnosis and should include urinalysis, blood tests, imaging studies, and possibly a biopsy or cystoscopy depending on the initial findings. It is important to consider all possible conditions and to rule out or confirm each potential diagnosis with appropriate investigations."
Displasia de grado alto en pacientes con esófago de Barrett,"+1 Esófago de Barrett:
El Esófago de Barrett es una condición en la cual el revestimiento del esófago cambia, convirtiéndose en un tipo de tejido similar al que se encuentra en el revestimiento del intestino. Esto ocurre generalmente como resultado de la exposición crónica al ácido estomacal debido al reflujo gastroesofágico. Los síntomas que el paciente tiene en común con esta enfermedad incluyen síntomas de reflujo gastroesofágico prolongados, como acidez y regurgitación, y la alteración del revestimiento del esófago. La transformación anormal en las células del revestimiento, clasificada como severa, también es consistente con el Esófago de Barrett. No se mencionan síntomas que el paciente no tenga en común con esta enfermedad.

+2 Adenocarcinoma esofágico:
El adenocarcinoma esofágico es un tipo de cáncer que se forma en las células glandulares del esófago, a menudo asociado con el Esófago de Barrett y la exposición crónica al ácido estomacal. Los síntomas pueden incluir dificultad para tragar, pérdida de peso y dolor en el pecho, además de síntomas de reflujo gastroesofágico. Los síntomas que el paciente tiene en común con esta enfermedad son la alteración del revestimiento del esófago y la transformación anormal de las células, lo que podría sugerir una progresión a cáncer. Sin embargo, no se mencionan otros síntomas típicos del adenocarcinoma esofágico, como la dificultad para tragar o la pérdida de peso.

+3 Estenosis esofágica:
La estenosis esofágica es el estrechamiento del esófago que puede ser causado por cicatrización debido al reflujo gastroesofágico crónico, entre otras causas. Los síntomas pueden incluir dificultad para tragar, regurgitación de alimentos y dolor al tragar. Los síntomas que el paciente tiene en común con esta enfermedad incluyen síntomas de reflujo gastroesofágico. No obstante, no se menciona la dificultad para tragar o el dolor al tragar, que son indicativos de estenosis.

+4 Acalasia:
La acalasia es un trastorno raro del esófago que afecta su capacidad para mover el alimento hacia el estómago y la relajación del esfínter esofágico inferior. Los síntomas incluyen dificultad para tragar, regurgitación de alimentos no digeridos, pérdida de peso y dolor en el pecho. Aunque los síntomas de reflujo gastroesofágico pueden ser similares, la acalasia se caracteriza por problemas con el movimiento del esófago y la relajación del esfínter, lo cual no se menciona en la descripción del paciente.

+5 Síndrome de Plummer-Vinson:
El síndrome de Plummer-Vinson es una condición rara caracterizada por la combinación de anemia por deficiencia de hierro, disfagia o dificultad para tragar y membranas esofágicas. Los síntomas pueden incluir fatiga, debilidad y dolor al tragar. Aunque la disfagia puede ser un síntoma común con el reflujo gastroesofágico, no se menciona la anemia por deficiencia de hierro ni las membranas esofágicas en la descripción del paciente.

Dado que los síntomas descritos en el estudio se alinean más estrechamente con el Esófago de Barrett y posiblemente con el adenocarcinoma esofágico, estos serían los diagnósticos más probables a considerar. Sin embargo, es importante realizar una evaluación clínica completa y pruebas diagnósticas adicionales para confirmar el diagnóstico y descartar otras condiciones."
Coartación ístmica,"+1 Coarctation of the Aorta:
This is a congenital condition where a portion of the aorta is narrowed, leading to obstructed blood flow. Symptoms that match include headaches, high blood pressure (which could cause nosebleeds), fatigue, coldness in the legs, difficulty exercising due to shortness of breath, and a decrease in pulse and blood pressure in the lower extremities. The chest X-ray findings of an enlarged heart and abnormal aortic arch are also consistent with this condition. The family history of congenital heart disorders supports this potential diagnosis.

+2 Marfan Syndrome:
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. While it has a wide range of symptoms, some that could match include an enlarged heart and aortic abnormalities. However, typical Marfan syndrome features such as long limbs and fingers, and eye lens dislocation are not mentioned. The patient's symptoms of headaches, nosebleeds, fatigue, and coldness in the legs are not classic signs of Marfan syndrome.

+3 Takayasu's Arteritis:
This is a rare inflammatory disease that affects the aorta and its branches. It could explain the decreased pulse and blood pressure in the lower extremities, fatigue, and shortness of breath. However, it is less common in males and typically presents with other symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and muscle pain, which are not reported in this patient.

+4 Eisenmenger Syndrome:
This condition arises from untreated congenital heart defects leading to pulmonary hypertension and eventual reversal of blood flow through the heart. Symptoms in common include shortness of breath and fatigue. However, the patient's symptoms do not include cyanosis (bluish coloration of the skin due to lack of oxygen), which is a key feature of Eisenmenger Syndrome. The mild enlargement of the heart could be related, but without more specific information on heart defects, this diagnosis is less certain.

+5 Fibromuscular Dysplasia:
This is a condition that causes abnormal growth within the walls of medium-sized arteries in the body and can lead to areas of stenosis. It might explain the decreased pulse and blood pressure in the lower extremities and the headaches. However, it is more common in women and does not typically cause heart enlargement or aortic arch abnormalities.

+6 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy:
This genetic heart disorder results in the thickening of the heart muscle, which can lead to obstruction of blood flow and symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain. The mild enlargement of the heart on the X-ray could be consistent with this condition. However, the specific symptom of decreased pulse and blood pressure in the lower extremities is not typical for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Given the symptoms and the family history of congenital heart disorders, the most likely diagnosis from this list appears to be Coarctation of the Aorta (+1). Further diagnostic tests, such as an echocardiogram, MRI, or CT angiography, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment."
Prurito urémico,"+1 Xeroderma Pigmentosum:
This rare genetic disorder is characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, leading to a higher risk of skin cancer. Patients often present with severe sunburns, freckling, dry skin, and changes in skin pigmentation. However, the patient's symptoms of severe itching primarily at night, loss of appetite, and the history of chronic kidney disease do not align with the typical presentation of Xeroderma Pigmentosum.

+2 Uremic Pruritus:
Also known as chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP), this condition is common in patients with advanced kidney disease or those on hemodialysis. Symptoms include persistent itching, which can be worse at night, dry skin, and pallor. The patient's symptoms of severe itching, especially at night, dry skin, pallor, fatigue, lethargy, and elevated urea and creatinine levels are consistent with uremic pruritus.

+3 Polycythemia Vera:
This is a rare blood disorder in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. It can cause itching, especially after a hot bath or shower, fatigue, and a ruddy complexion. However, the patient does not exhibit symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, or a ruddy complexion, and the presence of pallor is not typical for polycythemia vera.

+4 Primary Biliary Cholangitis:
This chronic disease causes the small bile ducts in the liver to become inflamed and damaged, eventually leading to scarring, liver failure, and other complications. Symptoms can include itching, dry skin, fatigue, and loss of appetite. However, the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the absence of other liver-related symptoms such as jaundice or abdominal pain make this diagnosis less likely.

+5 Hodgkin's Lymphoma:
A type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It can cause itching, loss of appetite, fatigue, and pallor. However, the patient does not report symptoms such as swollen lymph nodes, fever, or night sweats, which are commonly associated with Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

Given the patient's history and symptoms, Uremic Pruritus (+2) appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further investigation and differential diagnosis would be necessary to rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis."

Symptoms Not in Common: Presence of osteomas, soft tissue tumors, and other extracolonic manifestations.

+5 Whipple's Disease:
Whipple's Disease is a rare bacterial infection that can affect the gastrointestinal system and other organs, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, and joint pain.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Weight loss, fatigue.
Symptoms Not in Common: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, joint pain, systemic involvement.

+6 Chronic Radiation Enteritis:
Chronic Radiation Enteritis is a complication that can occur after radiation therapy to the abdomen or pelvis. It can lead to chronic inflammation of the intestines, with symptoms such as pain, frequent bowel movements, and bloody stools.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Rectal pain, increased frequency of bowel movements, occasional bloody stools, weight loss, fatigue.
Symptoms Not in Common: The symptoms listed are consistent with Chronic Radiation Enteritis, and the patient's history of radiation therapy for rectal cancer is a risk factor for this condition.

Given the patient's history and symptoms, Chronic Radiation Enteritis seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests such as a colonoscopy, imaging studies, and possibly a biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. It is important to consider the patient's recent medical history, particularly the radiation therapy, when evaluating the symptoms and potential causes."
Osteocondritis disecante,"+1 Osgood-Schlatter Disease:
Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common cause of knee pain in growing adolescents, particularly those who are active in sports. It is characterized by pain and swelling just below the knee, where the patellar tendon attaches to the shinbone (tibia). It is caused by repetitive stress or tension on the growth plate in the knee area, which can lead to inflammation or even a bony lump under the knee.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Persistent pain and stiffness in the knee, worsened by physical activity, swelling and tenderness around the knee joint.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: The patient does not report a bony lump below the knee, which is often associated with Osgood-Schlatter disease.

+5 Tumoral Calcinosis:
Tumoral calcinosis is a rare condition characterized by the development of large calcium deposits in the soft tissues around joints. These deposits can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the affected joint.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Persistent pain and stiffness in the knee, swelling around the knee joint.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: The patient does not report any hard lumps typical of tumoral calcinosis, and there is no family history which can sometimes be a factor in this condition.

+6 Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS):
PVNS is a rare joint disorder that involves the proliferation of the synovium, leading to pain, swelling, and reduced joint movement. It can also cause a locking sensation in the affected joint.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Persistent pain and stiffness in the knee, occasional locking and catching sensation, swelling around the knee joint.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: PVNS typically presents with more pronounced symptoms and may show joint effusion or darkened synovial fluid, which has not been mentioned.

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and a thorough clinical examination, including imaging and possibly laboratory tests, would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis."
Anencefalia/exencefalia aislada,"+1 Anencephaly:
Anencephaly is a serious birth defect in which a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull. It is a type of neural tube defect (NTD). The condition is characterized by the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp that occurs during embryonic development. It is usually diagnosed at birth or through an ultrasound examination before birth.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Severely underdeveloped brain and skull
- Cerebral hemispheres largely or completely missing
- Remaining brain tissue exposed or covered only by a thin layer of membrane

Symptoms Not in Common with Patient:
- Typically, infants with anencephaly do not survive long, and the condition is often associated with stillbirth or death shortly after birth. However, the patient is described as being in a stable condition, which is less common for anencephaly.

+2 Iniencephaly:
Iniencephaly is a rare neural tube defect characterized by extreme bending of the head to the spine, due to spinal and cranial malformations. The condition involves a defect in the occipital bone of the skull, leading to the absence of a large part of the brain and skull.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Underdeveloped brain and skull
- Abnormalities in cerebral hemispheres

Symptoms Not in Common with Patient:
- The defining feature of iniencephaly is the retroflexion of the head, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.
- The facial features in iniencephaly are often distorted due to the spinal and cranial malformations, whereas the patient's facial features are described as normally developed.

+3 Hydranencephaly:
Hydranencephaly is a condition where the cerebral hemispheres of the brain are absent and replaced by sacs filled with cerebrospinal fluid. It is often caused by vascular blockage or injury during fetal development.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Cerebral hemispheres are either largely or completely missing

Symptoms Not in Common with Patient:
- In hydranencephaly, the remaining brain structures are typically not exposed, as they are replaced by fluid-filled sacs, which is not described in the patient's condition.
- The patient's other organs seem unaffected, which may or may not align with hydranencephaly presentations, as this condition can sometimes involve additional neurological deficits.

Given the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is anencephaly. However, further diagnostic imaging and genetic testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. It is important to provide the family with genetic counseling and discuss the prognosis and care options for the patient."
Esofagitis eosinofílica,"+1 Achalasia:
Achalasia is a rare disorder of the esophagus, where the muscles fail to relax properly, leading to difficulty swallowing, regurgitation of food, and sometimes chest pain. Symptoms in common with the patient include trouble swallowing and food feeling stuck in the throat. However, achalasia typically does not cause chronic cough or heartburn, as the lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax rather than allowing acid reflux.

+2 Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE):
EoE is a chronic immune system disease where eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) build up in the lining of the esophagus, leading to difficulty swallowing, food impaction, and sometimes heartburn. Symptoms in common with the patient include trouble swallowing, food getting stuck in the throat, and a history of allergies and asthma, which are often associated with EoE. The patient's unresponsive heartburn could also be a symptom of EoE rather than typical gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The weight loss might be due to difficulty eating because of esophageal inflammation.

+3 Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:
This syndrome is characterized by one or more tumors that secrete excessive levels of gastrin, leading to increased stomach acid production, severe peptic ulcers, and reflux symptoms. Symptoms in common with the patient include persistent heartburn unresponsive to antacids and occasional chest pain. However, the patient does not report symptoms such as severe ulcers or diarrhea, which are also characteristic of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome.

+4 Diffuse Esophageal Spasm (DES):
DES is a condition where the esophagus experiences irregular, uncoordinated contractions, leading to difficulty swallowing, chest pain, and sometimes the sensation of food being stuck. Symptoms in common with the patient include trouble swallowing, chest pain, and the sensation of food being stuck in the throat. However, DES does not typically cause a chronic cough or weight loss.

+5 Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma):
Systemic sclerosis is a rare autoimmune disease that leads to hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues. It can also affect the esophagus, causing difficulty swallowing and reflux symptoms. Symptoms in common with the patient include trouble swallowing, heartburn, and weight loss. However, the patient does not present with the skin changes typically associated with scleroderma.

+6 Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR):
LPR is a condition similar to GERD, where stomach acid flows back into the throat, leading to symptoms such as chronic cough, hoarseness, and throat clearing. Symptoms in common with the patient include chronic cough and heartburn. However, LPR is less likely to cause trouble swallowing or food impaction, which the patient experiences.

Given the patient's symptoms, a thorough diagnostic workup including esophageal manometry, upper endoscopy, and possibly pH monitoring or other tests may be necessary to determine the exact cause of his symptoms and to rule out or confirm any of these rare diseases."
Tetralogía de Fallot,"+1 Tetralogy of Fallot:
Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that causes poor blood oxygenation. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanotic episodes, especially during crying or feeding, a bluish coloration of the skin, lips, and nail beds, and clubbing of fingers and toes. The ""to and fro"" murmur could be related to the heart defect, although typically a murmur associated with Tetralogy of Fallot is a systolic ejection murmur heard at the left upper sternal border. Symptoms not in common include frequent respiratory infections, which are not a direct symptom of Tetralogy of Fallot but could be secondary to the heart condition.

+2 Eisenmenger Syndrome:
Eisenmenger Syndrome is a long-term complication of congenital heart defects that cause left-to-right shunts, leading to pulmonary hypertension and cyanosis. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanotic episodes, bluish coloration of the skin, lips, and nail beds, and clubbing of fingers and toes. The frequent respiratory infections could be related to the increased pressure in the lungs. However, the ""to and fro"" murmur is not typical for Eisenmenger Syndrome, which is usually associated with a loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound (P2).

+3 Pulmonary Atresia:
Pulmonary atresia is a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary valve does not form properly. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanotic episodes, bluish coloration of the skin, lips, and nail beds, and signs of fatigue and lethargy. The ""to and fro"" murmur could be related to an associated ventricular septal defect or to the flow through a patent ductus arteriosus, which is often present to allow for some blood flow to the lungs. Symptoms not in common include the specific type of heart murmur, as a ""to and fro"" murmur is not typically described with pulmonary atresia.

+4 Tricuspid Atresia:
Tricuspid atresia is a type of congenital heart disease where the tricuspid heart valve is absent or abnormally developed. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanotic episodes, bluish coloration of the skin, lips, and nail beds, and clubbing of fingers and toes. The ""to and fro"" murmur could be related to the flow across a ventricular septal defect or an atrial septal defect, which are often present in this condition. Symptoms not in common include the specific type of heart murmur, as tricuspid atresia typically presents with a systolic murmur due to the ventricular septal defect and not a ""to and fro"" murmur.

+5 Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR):
TAPVR is a rare congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanotic episodes, bluish coloration of the skin, lips, and nail beds, and signs of fatigue and lethargy. The frequent respiratory infections could be related to the abnormal return of oxygenated blood to the right side of the heart. Symptoms not in common include the ""to and fro"" murmur, which is not typically associated with TAPVR, and the clubbing of fingers and toes, which may develop later in life with this condition.

Given the symptoms presented, it is important to conduct further diagnostic tests, such as an echocardiogram, chest X-ray, and possibly cardiac catheterization, to confirm the diagnosis and understand the severity of the condition. Treatment options will vary depending on the specific diagnosis and may include medical management, interventional procedures, or surgery."
Neurofibromatosis tipo,"+1 Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1):
Neurofibromatosis Type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign tumors called neurofibromas, which grow on nerves throughout the body. It can also cause skin abnormalities such as café-au-lait spots and freckling in the armpit or groin areas.

The condition can also lead to developmental delays, skin abnormalities such as hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, and shagreen patches, as well as seizures and behavioral problems.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Skin abnormalities
- Benign tumors in the brain
- Learning difficulties

Uncommon Symptoms with Patient:
- Seizures and specific skin lesions associated with TSC may not have been reported.
- No mention of tumors in organs other than the brain and skin.

+3 Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS):
Sturge-Weber Syndrome is a rare neurological and skin disorder. It is characterized by a congenital facial birthmark called a port-wine stain, neurological abnormalities, and glaucoma. Individuals with SWS may also have seizures and developmental delays. The disorder is caused by a somatic mutation in the GNAQ gene.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Skin abnormalities
- Learning difficulties

Uncommon Symptoms with Patient:
- The presence of a port-wine stain, glaucoma, and seizures are not mentioned among the symptoms of the individuals.

+4 McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS):
McCune-Albright Syndrome is a complex genetic disorder affecting the bone, skin, and endocrine systems. It is characterized by fibrous dysplasia of the bone, café-au-lait spots, and endocrine abnormalities, including precocious puberty. The condition is caused by mutations in the GNAS gene.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Skin abnormalities
- Problems with bone development

Uncommon Symptoms with Patient:
- Endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty have not been described.
- Specific mention of café-au-lait spots is lacking.

Please note that this is a hypothetical exercise and real-life diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, genetic testing, and consideration of the full spectrum of symptoms and medical history."
Hipotiroidismo congénito permanente,"+1 Congenital Hypothyroidism:
This condition is characterized by an underactive thyroid gland present from birth, leading to insufficient thyroid hormone production. Symptoms the patient has in common include lethargy, poor feeding habits, reduced activity, protruded abdomen, large thick tongue, dry cold skin, and delays in growth and development. Symptoms not in common with the patient's presentation are jaundice, constipation, and a hoarse cry, which are also frequently observed in congenital hypothyroidism.

+2 Prader-Willi Syndrome:
Prader-Willi Syndrome is a genetic disorder that typically causes low muscle tone, short stature, incomplete sexual development, cognitive disabilities, problem behaviors, and a chronic feeling of hunger that can lead to excessive eating and life-threatening obesity. Symptoms the patient has in common include poor feeding habits in infancy, reduced activity, and notable delays in growth and development. Symptoms not in common include an insatiable appetite and obesity, which usually develop later in childhood.

+3 Pompe Disease:
Pompe Disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that leads to the accumulation of glycogen in the body's cells. Symptoms the patient has in common include muscle weakness (which may be observed as reduced activity), a protruded abdomen due to enlarged liver or spleen, and difficulties in gaining weight. Symptoms not in common include muscle pain, respiratory difficulties, and heart defects, which are also associated with Pompe Disease.

+4 Cystic Fibrosis:
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory and digestive systems. Symptoms the patient has in common include poor growth, weight gain difficulties, and a protruded abdomen due to digestive issues. Symptoms not in common include persistent cough, frequent lung infections, and salty-tasting skin, which are characteristic of cystic fibrosis.

+5 Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome:
This is an overgrowth disorder usually present at birth, characterized by an increased risk of childhood cancer and certain congenital features. Symptoms the patient has in common include a protruded abdomen, large tongue (macroglossia), and growth abnormalities. Symptoms not in common include hemihypertrophy (asymmetrical growth of one side of the body), ear creases or pits, and neonatal hypoglycemia.

+6 Zellweger Syndrome:
Zellweger Syndrome is a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder that affects the ability of cells to break down certain substances, leading to a buildup of toxic compounds. Symptoms the patient has in common include hypotonia (which may present as lethargy), difficulty in feeding, and developmental delays. Symptoms not in common include distinctive facial features, hearing and vision impairment, and seizures, which are also seen in Zellweger Syndrome.

Please note that these are potential rare diseases based on the symptoms provided, and further diagnostic tests such as blood tests, imaging, and possibly genetic testing would be necessary to confirm any diagnosis."
Toxoplasmosis congénita,"+1 Neonatal Hemochromatosis:
Neonatal hemochromatosis is a rare liver disorder characterized by severe liver damage and extrahepatic iron accumulation. Symptoms that match include jaundice, liver enlargement, and elevated liver enzymes. However, the condition does not typically present with fever or retinal inflammation, and there is no direct link to maternal flu-like symptoms or cat ownership.

+2 Congenital Toxoplasmosis:
Congenital toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which can be transmitted from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy. Symptoms in common include jaundice, fever, an enlarged liver and spleen, muscle weakness, poor coordination, and retinal inflammation. The mother's history of flu-like symptoms and contact with cat litter (a common source of T. gondii) are also consistent with this diagnosis. Elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels can be associated with this infection.

+3 Biliary Atresia:
Biliary atresia is a rare condition in newborns where the bile ducts are blocked or absent, leading to liver damage. Symptoms that match include jaundice, an enlarged liver, and elevated liver enzymes. However, biliary atresia does not typically cause fever, retinal inflammation, or neurological symptoms like muscle weakness and poor coordination, and it is not related to maternal health or cat ownership.

+4 Niemann-Pick Disease Type C:
Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare genetic disorder affecting lipid metabolism, leading to the accumulation of lipids in various organs. Symptoms in common with the patient's presentation include jaundice, an enlarged liver and spleen, and neurological symptoms such as muscle weakness and poor coordination. However, fever and retinal inflammation are not typical initial symptoms, and there is no direct connection to maternal flu-like symptoms or cat ownership.

+5 Congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection:
Congenital CMV infection occurs when a mother passes the CMV virus to her baby during pregnancy. Symptoms that match include jaundice, an enlarged liver and spleen, and neurological symptoms. Retinal inflammation can also be a feature of CMV infection. However, fever is not a typical symptom in neonates with CMV, and the mother's flu-like symptoms and cat ownership are not directly related to CMV.

Given the symptoms and the maternal history, congenital toxoplasmosis seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, such as PCR testing for Toxoplasma gondii, liver biopsy, or specific metabolic and genetic tests, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Insuficiencia placentaria,"+1 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues and can cause a wide range of symptoms, including skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and tissue fragility. In some types of EDS, pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of complications such as premature rupture of membranes or bleeding. However, EDS is not typically associated with fetal growth restriction or decreased fetal movements.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- History of hypertension (vascular type of EDS can be associated with blood pressure issues)
- Previous miscarriages (can be a feature in some types of EDS due to tissue fragility)

Symptoms Not in Common:
- Recurrent episodes of light vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are not specific to EDS.
- Decreased fetal movements are not a typical feature of EDS.
- Fetal growth restriction is not a hallmark of EDS.

+2 Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS):
Antiphospholipid Syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood, which can increase the risk of blood clots. This condition can lead to pregnancy complications such as recurrent miscarriages, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia, which may cause hypertension.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- History of hypertension (APS can lead to preeclampsia)
- Previous miscarriages (a common feature of APS)
- Recurrent episodes of light vaginal bleeding (can be associated with placental issues due to APS)

Symptoms Not in Common:
- Decreased fetal movements and fetal growth restriction are not specific to APS but can be secondary to placental insufficiency related to APS.

+3 Placental Abruption:
Placental abruption is a serious condition in which the placenta partially or completely separates from the uterus before delivery. This can lead to fetal distress, growth restriction, and increased risk of miscarriage or stillbirth.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Recurrent episodes of light vaginal bleeding (a symptom of placental abruption)
- Abdominal pain (can be associated with placental abruption)
- Decreased fetal movements (can occur due to fetal distress related to placental abruption)
- Fetal growth restriction (can be a consequence of placental abruption)

Symptoms Not in Common:
- History of hypertension is a risk factor for placental abruption but not a symptom of the condition itself.

+4 Uterine Rupture:
Uterine rupture is a rare but serious complication during pregnancy where the uterine wall tears, which can lead to bleeding and compromise to the fetus. It is more common in women with a history of uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery, but can occur spontaneously.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Abdominal pain (a symptom of uterine rupture)
- Recurrent episodes of light vaginal bleeding (can occur with uterine rupture)

Symptoms Not in Common:
- Decreased fetal movements and fetal growth restriction are not specific to uterine rupture but can be secondary to the acute event.
- History of hypertension is not related to uterine rupture.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, it is important to conduct further investigations, including laboratory tests for antiphospholipid antibodies, detailed ultrasound to assess placental health and amniotic fluid volume, and close fetal monitoring to determine the cause of the decreased fetal movements and fetal growth restriction. Immediate medical attention is required to manage the patient's condition and ensure the safety of both the mother and the fetus."
Síndrome de X frágil,"+1 Fragile X Syndrome:
Fragile X Syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes a range of developmental problems including cognitive impairment and learning disabilities. Symptoms often include elongated faces, large ears, and hyperextensible joints, which are consistent with the patient sample. Behavioral issues such as anxiety, hyperactivity, and autistic-like behaviors are also common in Fragile X Syndrome. This condition is more prevalent in males, and females often have milder symptoms, aligning with the patient sample's gender distribution. The family history of similar symptoms in the patient sample suggests a genetic component, which is characteristic of Fragile X Syndrome as it is passed down through the X chromosome.

Common Symptoms with Patient Sample:
- Cognitive impairment
- Learning disabilities
- Elongated faces
- Large ears
- Hyperextensible joints
- Social and behavioral issues (anxiety, hyperactivity, autistic-like behaviors)
- Predominantly male with milder symptoms in females
- Family history of similar symptoms

Non-Common Symptoms with Patient Sample:
- No specific non-common symptoms identified as the patient sample aligns well with Fragile X Syndrome characteristics.

+2 Turner Syndrome:
Turner Syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects females, where one of the X chromosomes is missing or partially missing. It can lead to a variety of medical and developmental problems, including short stature and heart defects. However, cognitive impairment and learning disabilities can occur, and some individuals may have social and behavioral issues.

Common Symptoms with Patient Sample:
- Learning disabilities (in some cases)
- Social and behavioral issues (in some cases)

Non-Common Symptoms with Patient Sample:
- Predominantly affects females, which does not align with the predominantly male patient sample.
- Short stature and heart defects, which are not mentioned in the patient sample.
- The physical characteristics such as elongated faces, large ears, and hyperextensible joints are not typical of Turner Syndrome.

+3 Marfan Syndrome:
Marfan Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, leading to features such as long limbs, hyperextensible joints, and sometimes facial characteristics. It can also cause heart, eyes, and skeletal issues.

Common Symptoms with Patient Sample:
- Hyperextensible joints

Non-Common Symptoms with Patient Sample:
- Cognitive impairment and learning disabilities are not typical features of Marfan Syndrome.
- The patient sample's cognitive and behavioral symptoms do not align with Marfan Syndrome.
- The gender distribution and family history do not specifically suggest Marfan Syndrome, as it affects both males and females equally.

+4 Klinefelter Syndrome:
Klinefelter Syndrome is a genetic condition that affects males who are born with an extra X chromosome. It can lead to physical, developmental, and cognitive impairments, including learning disabilities and sometimes behavioral issues. However, it does not typically present with elongated faces or large ears.

Common Symptoms with Patient Sample:
- Learning disabilities
- Behavioral issues (in some cases)
- Predominantly male patient sample

Non-Common Symptoms with Patient Sample:
- Elongated faces and large ears are not typical of Klinefelter Syndrome.
- Hyperextensible joints are not a common feature of Klinefelter Syndrome.
- The cognitive impairment in Klinefelter Syndrome may not be as pronounced as in the patient sample.

Given the symptoms presented in the patient sample, Fragile X Syndrome appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further genetic testing would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Síndrome de X frágil,"+1 Fragile X Syndrome:
Fragile X Syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes a range of developmental problems including cognitive impairment and learning disabilities. Symptoms often include an elongated face, large ears, and flat feet, which are consistent with the patient's physical characteristics. Behavioral symptoms such as hyperactivity, attention deficits, and impulsivity are also common, as are difficulties with social interactions and communication, which align with the patient's social anxiety and communication challenges. The repetitive behaviors mentioned could also be a sign of this condition. The family history of similar manifestations in the maternal lineage supports the possibility of Fragile X Syndrome, as it is an X-linked disorder. However, without additional symptoms such as connective tissue problems or seizures, which can also be associated with Fragile X, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed solely on the presented symptoms.

+2 Marfan Syndrome:
Marfan Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue and can lead to features such as a tall and slender build, long arms, legs, fingers, and toes, and flat feet. While the patient does have flat feet, he does not exhibit other common physical characteristics of Marfan Syndrome, such as a tall and slender build or disproportionately long limbs. Additionally, Marfan Syndrome does not typically cause learning disabilities or cognitive impairment, which are prominent in the patient's presentation. Therefore, the symptoms do not align closely with Marfan Syndrome.

+3 Klinefelter Syndrome:
Klinefelter Syndrome is a chromosomal disorder in males that results from an extra X chromosome and can lead to physical and cognitive impairments. Common symptoms include learning disabilities and delayed speech and language development, which could correlate with the patient's cognitive impairment and communication difficulties. However, typical physical features associated with Klinefelter Syndrome, such as reduced muscle mass, reduced facial and body hair, and enlarged breast tissue, are not mentioned in the patient's presentation. Additionally, Klinefelter Syndrome is not usually characterized by hyperactivity or attention deficits. The genetic link in the family history also does not typically follow the pattern seen in Klinefelter Syndrome, which is not usually inherited. Thus, the patient's symptoms do not strongly suggest Klinefelter Syndrome.

+4 Williams Syndrome:
Williams Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive, ""elfin"" facial appearance, intellectual disability, a unique personality profile that includes being overly friendly, and heart problems. While the patient does exhibit learning disabilities and cognitive impairment, the specific facial features and cardiovascular issues commonly seen in Williams Syndrome are not described in the patient's symptoms. Additionally, the patient's social anxiety contrasts with the typical highly social and empathetic personality seen in Williams Syndrome. The genetic link mentioned does not typically align with the sporadic genetic deletion that causes Williams Syndrome. Therefore, the patient's symptoms do not appear to be consistent with Williams Syndrome.

+5 Turner Syndrome:
Turner Syndrome is a condition that affects females and involves a partial or complete absence of one of the X chromosomes. It is characterized by short stature, delayed puberty, infertility, heart defects, and certain learning disabilities. Given that the patient is male and the symptoms do not align with the typical presentation of Turner Syndrome, this condition is not a likely diagnosis.

Based on the information provided and the alignment of symptoms, Fragile X Syndrome seems to be the most likely diagnosis to consider for this patient. However, further genetic testing and evaluation by a specialist in genetic disorders would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Daño de la médula espinal,"+1 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues and can lead to joint hypermobility, skin that stretches easily, and tissue fragility. 
- Symptoms in common: Chronic back pain and episodes of localized numbness could potentially be related to EDS.
- Symptoms not in common: EDS typically does not cause a loss of sensation and muscle strength below the chest level or issues with bladder and bowel control due to a traumatic event.

+2 Transverse Myelitis:
Transverse Myelitis is an inflammation of both sides of one section of the spinal cord, which can disrupt the messages that the spinal cord nerves send throughout the body.
+ Symptoms in common: Loss of sensation and muscle strength below the chest level, mobility issues, and problems with bladder and bowel control are characteristic of transverse myelitis.
- Symptoms not in common: The condition is usually not a direct result of physical trauma like a motorcycle accident.

+3 Spinal Cord Injury (SCI):
Spinal Cord Injury results from damage to the spinal cord due to trauma, loss of its normal blood supply, or compression from tumor or infection.
+ Symptoms in common: The loss of sensation and muscle strength below the chest level, mobility issues, and bladder and bowel control problems are consistent with SCI, which could be a result of the motorcycle accident.
- Symptoms not in common: Chronic back pain and numbness prior to the accident are not typically caused by SCI but could be pre-existing conditions that were exacerbated by the accident.

+4 Multiple Sclerosis (MS):
Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic illness involving your central nervous system (CNS). The immune system attacks myelin, which is the protective layer around nerve fibers.
- Symptoms in common: Chronic back pain and episodes of localized numbness could be related to MS.
- Symptoms not in common: MS does not usually present with acute symptoms following physical trauma and is not typically associated with injuries like those sustained in a motorcycle accident.

+5 Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS):
Guillain-Barré Syndrome is a rare disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. Weakness and tingling in the extremities are usually the first symptoms.
- Symptoms in common: The loss of sensation and muscle strength could be related to GBS.
- Symptoms not in common: GBS is an acute disorder that typically does not follow a traumatic event like a motorcycle accident and is more often associated with infection.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, particularly the severe motorcycle accident and the subsequent loss of sensation and muscle strength below the chest level, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be a Spinal Cord Injury. However, a thorough medical evaluation, including imaging studies and possibly a neurological consultation, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Sepsis en neonatos prematuros,"+1 Neonatal Sepsis:
Neonatal sepsis is a type of infection in the bloodstream that affects newborns, particularly those who are preterm. The symptoms you've described, such as temperature instability, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered white blood cell count, are all consistent with neonatal sepsis. The positive blood culture results for bacterial or fungal infections also support this diagnosis. Since the study population consists of premature infants with signs of systemic inflammatory response and positive blood cultures, neonatal sepsis is a likely diagnosis.

+2 Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC):
NEC is a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature infants. It involves inflammation and, in severe cases, the death of tissue in the intestine. Common symptoms include abdominal distension and feeding intolerance, which may not have been specifically mentioned in your description. However, systemic inflammatory response and altered white blood cell count could be associated with NEC. The absence of symptoms like bloody stools makes this diagnosis less likely compared to neonatal sepsis.

+3 Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD):
BPD is a chronic lung disorder that primarily affects premature infants who have required mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. It is characterized by inflammation and scarring in the lungs. Symptoms can include tachypnea and difficulty breathing, which align with the symptoms you've described. However, BPD does not typically present with systemic infection or positive blood cultures, making this diagnosis less probable for the described study population.

+4 Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP):
ROP is a disease that affects the eyes of premature infants, potentially leading to blindness. It is caused by abnormal growth of retinal blood vessels. The primary risk factors are prematurity and oxygen therapy. While ROP is a concern in premature infants, it does not present with systemic inflammatory response or altered white blood cell counts, and there would be no positive blood cultures. Therefore, ROP does not match the symptoms described in your study population.

+5 Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH):
IVH is bleeding into the brain's ventricular system, which can occur in premature infants due to the fragility of their blood vessels. Symptoms can include apnea, changes in muscle tone, and a bulging fontanelle. While IVH can be associated with systemic issues in severe cases, it does not typically present with systemic inflammatory response or positive blood cultures. Thus, IVH does not align with the symptoms you've described.

+6 Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA):
PDA is a condition where the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth, which is more common in premature infants. It can lead to heart failure and poor oxygenation. Symptoms may include tachycardia and tachypnea. However, PDA does not cause systemic inflammatory response or positive blood cultures, and it is not typically associated with an altered white blood cell count, making this diagnosis less likely for the study population.

Given the symptoms and the context provided, neonatal sepsis (+1) is the most likely diagnosis for the study population of premature infants showing signs of systemic inflammatory response and having positive blood culture results."
Queratoconjuntivitis primaveral,"+1 Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Recurrent bouts of red, itchy eyes, worsening during spring and summer (allergy seasons), gritty feeling in the eyes, thick, ropey discharge, small bumps under the eyelids (papillae), visibly inflamed eyes, history of seasonal allergies.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: The patient's symptoms persist despite the use of antihistamines and eye drops, which may indicate a more severe or resistant form of allergic conjunctivitis or a different condition altogether.

+2 Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis:
Common Symptoms with Patient: History of seasonal allergies, red and itchy eyes, inflamed eyes, and a gritty feeling in the eyes.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is more common in older patients and often associated with a personal or family history of atopic dermatitis, which is not specified for this patient.

+3 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS):
Common Symptoms with Patient: Red, itchy eyes, inflamed eyes.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: SJS is typically associated with a more severe systemic reaction, often triggered by a medication or infection, and includes symptoms such as fever, blistering, and skin peeling, which the patient does not exhibit.

+4 Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Red, itchy eyes, gritty feeling in the eyes, thick, ropey discharge, small bumps under the eyelids (giant papillae).
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: This condition is often associated with contact lens wear or the presence of a foreign body, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

+5 Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Red, itchy eyes, inflamed eyes, gritty feeling in the eyes.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune disorder that leads to scarring and is not typically associated with seasonal allergies. It also progresses to more severe symptoms over time, which is not indicated in the patient's presentation.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, vernal keratoconjunctivitis seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further testing and evaluation by an ophthalmologist or allergist would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Transposición de las grandes arterias,"+1 Congenital Heart Disease:
Congenital heart disease (CHD) refers to a range of structural problems in the heart that are present from birth. These defects can affect the walls of the heart, the valves of the heart, and the arteries and veins near the heart. Symptoms can include breathlessness, rapid breathing, a bluish skin tone (cyanosis), fatigue, and poor feeding, which are all present in the patient. A heart murmur, as noted during auscultation, is also a common finding in CHD. The patient's symptoms align with this condition, but further diagnostic imaging like an echocardiogram would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

+2 Tetralogy of Fallot:
Tetralogy of Fallot is a specific type of congenital heart defect that includes four heart abnormalities: a ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. Symptoms include cyanosis, difficulty in feeding, failure to gain weight, and a heart murmur, all of which are present in the patient. The onset of symptoms shortly after birth is also consistent with this condition. However, additional tests such as an echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization are required to confirm the diagnosis.

+3 Transposition of the Great Arteries:
This is a serious but rare heart defect present at birth, in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed (transposed). Symptoms include cyanosis, rapid breathing, and difficulty feeding, which the patient exhibits. A heart murmur may not be as prominent in this condition as in others, but it can still be present. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this condition, and a definitive diagnosis would require imaging studies such as an echocardiogram or a cardiac MRI.

+4 Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN):
PPHN is a rare lung condition in newborns that causes high blood pressure in the lungs, leading to low oxygen levels in the bloodstream. Symptoms include rapid breathing, breathlessness, and cyanosis, which are present in the patient. However, PPHN typically does not cause a heart murmur, and the patient's symptoms of poor feeding and difficulty gaining weight are not as specific to PPHN. Echocardiography and blood gas analysis would be used to diagnose this condition.

+5 Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR):
TAPVR is a rare congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Instead, they connect to the right side of the heart, causing oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood. Symptoms include cyanosis, rapid breathing, and poor feeding, which the patient has. A heart murmur can also be associated with this condition. Diagnosis would require an echocardiogram or other imaging studies.

+6 Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS):
HLHS is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by the underdevelopment of the left side of the heart. This leads to poor blood flow and low oxygen levels in the body. Symptoms include cyanosis, rapid breathing, fatigue, and poor feeding, which are consistent with the patient's presentation. A heart murmur may also be present. An echocardiogram would be essential for diagnosis.

+7 Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACD/MPV):
ACD/MPV is a very rare and fatal lung disorder in infants, which involves abnormal development of the capillary vascular system around the alveoli of the lungs. Symptoms include severe respiratory distress, cyanosis, and failure to thrive, which are seen in the patient. However, a heart murmur is not a typical feature of this disease. Diagnosis is usually confirmed through a lung biopsy.

In summary, the patient's symptoms are most consistent with a congenital heart defect, and further diagnostic testing is warranted to determine the specific type and to plan appropriate treatment."
Retinosis pigmentaria,"+1 Retinitis Pigmentosa:
Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing at night and a loss of peripheral vision. The patient's history of progressive night vision problems, worsening peripheral vision, occasional flashes of light, and difficulty in color perception are consistent with RP. The genetic component is also supported by the family history of similar visual impairments. The patient does not report other ocular trauma or surgery, which aligns with the typical presentation of RP.

+2 Usher Syndrome:
Usher Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects both hearing and vision. The vision loss is due to RP, which the patient shows symptoms of, including night blindness, loss of peripheral vision, and difficulty with color perception. However, Usher Syndrome also includes hearing loss, which the patient has not reported. Therefore, while the visual symptoms match, the absence of hearing loss suggests this may not be the correct diagnosis.

+3 Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON):
LHON is a mitochondrial genetic disorder that leads to sudden vision loss, primarily in young adult males. The patient's symptoms of difficulty seeing at night and loss of peripheral vision could be consistent with LHON. However, LHON typically presents with a rapid onset of central vision loss, rather than the progressive peripheral vision loss and night blindness over decades that the patient reports. Additionally, the patient's age at symptom onset and the gradual progression of the disease are not typical of LHON.

+4 Choroideremia:
Choroideremia is a rare inherited disorder that causes progressive vision loss due to degeneration of the choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and photoreceptors. Symptoms include night blindness and loss of peripheral vision, which the patient has. However, choroideremia typically presents earlier in life and progresses to include complete blindness, which the patient has not yet experienced. The patient's symptoms align with the typical progression of choroideremia, but additional testing would be required to confirm this diagnosis.

+5 Cone-Rod Dystrophy:
Cone-rod dystrophy is a group of inherited eye disorders that affect the cone and rod cells of the retina, leading to deterioration of central vision and color perception before the peripheral vision. The patient's difficulty with color perception and progressive vision loss could be indicative of this condition. However, the primary symptom of cone-rod dystrophy is the loss of central vision, whereas the patient reports a loss of peripheral vision, which is less common in the early stages of this disease.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, Retinitis Pigmentosa (+1) seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, such as a detailed retinal examination, genetic testing, and possibly electroretinography (ERG), would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Policitemia vera,"+1 Polycythemia Vera:
Polycythemia vera is a rare blood disorder in which the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells. This can lead to increased blood viscosity and clotting issues. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, headache, dizziness, burning sensation in hands and feet, itchy skin, enlarged spleen, high number of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells, high blood viscosity, episodes of deep vein thrombosis, and the JAK2 gene mutation. Symptoms not in common include the patient's good appetite and lack of significant weight loss, as some patients with polycythemia vera may experience weight loss due to an enlarged spleen causing early satiety.

+2 Essential Thrombocythemia:
Essential thrombocythemia is a rare chronic blood disorder characterized by the overproduction of platelets by the bone marrow, which can lead to increased clotting. Symptoms in common with the patient include headache, dizziness, burning sensation in hands and feet, enlarged spleen, high number of platelets, and a predisposition to clotting, such as deep vein thrombosis. Symptoms not in common include the high number of red blood cells and white blood cells, as essential thrombocythemia primarily involves platelets. The patient's good appetite and lack of significant weight loss are not typically associated with essential thrombocythemia.

+3 Primary Myelofibrosis:
Primary myelofibrosis is a rare bone marrow disorder that disrupts the body's normal production of blood cells, leading to extensive scarring in the bone marrow. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, an enlarged spleen, and abnormal blood counts, including an increased number of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. The high blood viscosity and clotting episodes are also consistent with primary myelofibrosis. Symptoms not in common include the patient's good appetite and lack of significant weight loss, as patients with primary myelofibrosis often experience symptoms such as anemia, which can lead to fatigue and weight loss.

+4 Systemic Mastocytosis:
Systemic mastocytosis is a rare disorder caused by the accumulation of mast cells in various body tissues, which can lead to a variety of symptoms. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, headache, and itchy skin, especially after bathing. However, systemic mastocytosis typically does not cause an enlarged spleen due to the overproduction of normal blood cells or a high blood cell count. The patient's blood viscosity and clotting issues, as well as the JAK2 gene mutation, are not characteristic of systemic mastocytosis.

+5 Waldenström Macroglobulinemia:
Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that involves the overproduction of IgM antibodies, leading to hyperviscosity of the blood. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, headache, dizziness, and high blood viscosity. However, Waldenström macroglobulinemia typically presents with high levels of IgM antibodies rather than an elevated number of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells. The JAK2 gene mutation is also not associated with this disease.

Given the patient's symptoms and blood test results, including the JAK2 gene mutation, the most likely diagnosis from this list of rare diseases is Polycythemia Vera (+1). However, a thorough clinical evaluation and additional diagnostic tests would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Miocardiopatía periparto,"+1 Peripartum cardiomyopathy:
Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare form of heart failure that occurs during the last month of pregnancy or up to five months postpartum. The patient's symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, palpitations, and difficulty in completing daily activities due to faintness and rapid heart rate are consistent with this condition. The recent childbirth and the presentation of an elevated heart rate and peripheral edema during the physical examination also align with peripartum cardiomyopathy. However, the patient does not have a known history of heart disease, which is not a necessary factor for this diagnosis.

+2 Pheochromocytoma:
Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland tissue that can cause the gland to produce too much adrenaline, leading to symptoms such as palpitations, rapid heart rate, and fatigue. The patient's symptoms of palpitations and rapid heart rate could suggest this condition. However, the patient's recent childbirth and the absence of other symptoms such as headaches, sweating, and high blood pressure at the time of examination make this diagnosis less likely.

+3 Pulmonary embolism:
A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, often caused by blood clots that travel from the legs or other parts of the body. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and faintness, which the patient is experiencing. The recent childbirth could be a risk factor for clot formation. However, the patient does not present with chest pain or coughing up blood, which are also common symptoms of pulmonary embolism.

+4 Thyroid storm:
Thyroid storm is a rare but life-threatening health condition that is a complication of hyperthyroidism. It can present with symptoms such as rapid heart rate, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The patient's symptoms of palpitations and elevated heart rate could be indicative of this condition. However, the patient does not exhibit other symptoms such as fever, agitation, or diarrhea, which are often associated with thyroid storm.

+5 Postpartum thyroiditis:
Postpartum thyroiditis is a rare condition that can occur after childbirth, where the thyroid gland becomes inflamed. Symptoms can include fatigue, palpitations, and difficulty in completing daily activities. The patient's recent childbirth and symptoms align with this condition. However, the patient does not present with symptoms of thyroid dysfunction such as changes in weight, which are commonly seen in thyroiditis.

+6 Cardiac arrhythmia:
Cardiac arrhythmias are conditions that cause the heart to beat irregularly, too fast, or too slow. The patient's symptoms of palpitations, rapid heart rate, and faintness could suggest an arrhythmia. The recent childbirth could have put additional stress on the heart, potentially unmasking an arrhythmia. However, without further diagnostic tests such as an ECG, it is difficult to confirm this diagnosis.

+7 Idiopathic postpartum cardiomyopathy:
This is a subset of peripartum cardiomyopathy where the cause of the heart failure is unknown. The patient's symptoms and recent childbirth are consistent with this diagnosis. The lack of a family history of heart disease and the absence of known heart disease in the patient herself are also typical of idiopathic postpartum cardiomyopathy.

Given the patient's symptoms and recent childbirth, it is important to conduct further diagnostic tests, including an echocardiogram, blood tests, and possibly a chest X-ray or CT scan, to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment."
Sarcoma de partes blandas,"+1 Fibrosarcoma:
Fibrosarcoma is a rare cancer that develops from fibrous tissue and can occur in any part of the body, most commonly the legs, arms, or trunk. It typically presents as a painless, deep-seated mass that can grow rapidly and cause local discomfort. 
Common symptoms with the patient: Large, progressively growing mass on the thigh, discomfort, and restricted mobility.
Symptoms not in common: Typically, fibrosarcoma does not cause systemic symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, and diminished appetite in its early stages.

+2 Liposarcoma:
Liposarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises in fat cells in deep soft tissue, such as that inside the thigh. It can grow to be quite large and cause symptoms as it compresses surrounding structures.
Common symptoms with the patient: Large, progressively growing mass on the thigh, discomfort, restricted mobility, fatigue, weight loss, and diminished appetite.
Symptoms not in common: Liposarcoma can sometimes present with inflammation if it becomes infected or necrotic, but this is not always the case.

+3 Leiomyosarcoma:
Leiomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that affects smooth muscle cells, often found in the uterus, gastrointestinal tract, or blood vessels, but can also occur in the extremities.
Common symptoms with the patient: Large, progressively growing mass on the thigh, discomfort, restricted mobility, fatigue, weight loss, and diminished appetite.
Symptoms not in common: Leiomyosarcoma in the limbs is less common than in other locations, and the patient's history of heavy smoking is not a known risk factor.

+4 Schwannoma (Neurilemmoma):
Schwannoma is a typically benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells of the nerve sheath. It can occur anywhere in the body but is often found in the head, neck, and extremities.
Common symptoms with the patient: Large, progressively growing mass on the thigh, discomfort, and restricted mobility.
Symptoms not in common: Schwannomas are usually slow-growing and may not cause significant symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, and diminished appetite.

+5 Desmoid Tumor (Aggressive Fibromatosis):
Desmoid tumors are benign fibrous growths that can occur throughout the body but are most common in the abdomen, arms, and legs. They can be aggressive and infiltrate surrounding tissues.
Common symptoms with the patient: Large, progressively growing mass on the thigh, discomfort, and restricted mobility.
Symptoms not in common: Desmoid tumors do not typically cause systemic symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, and diminished appetite.

+6 Myxofibrosarcoma:
Myxofibrosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that often occurs in the limbs of older adults. It is characterized by a gelatinous appearance due to the presence of myxoid stroma.
Common symptoms with the patient: Large, progressively growing mass on the thigh, discomfort, restricted mobility, fatigue, weight loss, and diminished appetite.
Symptoms not in common: Myxofibrosarcoma may not always present with systemic symptoms early on, but they can occur as the disease progresses.

Given the patient's symptoms, further diagnostic workup, including imaging (MRI or CT scan) and biopsy of the mass, would be essential to determine the exact nature of the mass and to confirm the diagnosis. Additional tests such as blood work and a thorough physical examination would also be necessary to assess the patient's overall health and to rule out metastatic disease or other conditions."
Hipersomnia idiopática,"+1 Narcolepsy:
Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. Patients with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and may have sleep attacks, which are sudden episodes of falling asleep during the day. Common symptoms include:
- Excessive daytime sleepiness (common with the patient)
- Sleep attacks (common with the patient)
- Cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone, not reported by the patient)
- Sleep paralysis (not reported by the patient)
- Hallucinations upon falling asleep or waking up (not reported by the patient)

+2 Idiopathic hypersomnia:
Idiopathic hypersomnia is a condition characterized by excessive sleepiness without an obvious cause. It is similar to narcolepsy but without some of the other associated features. Symptoms include:
- Excessive daytime sleepiness (common with the patient)
- Long sleep times (common with the patient)
- Difficulty waking up from sleep (not reported by the patient)
- Sleep drunkenness (confusion or disorientation upon waking, not reported by the patient)

+3 Kleine-Levin Syndrome:
Kleine-Levin Syndrome is a rare sleep disorder, often referred to as 'sleeping beauty syndrome,' characterized by recurring episodes of excessive sleep. Symptoms can include:
- Periods of excessive sleep (not reported as episodic by the patient)
- Altered behavior during episodes (not reported by the patient)
- Cognitive dysfunction (not reported by the patient)
- Hypersexuality (not reported by the patient)
- Compulsive eating (not reported by the patient)

+4 Prader-Willi Syndrome:
Prader-Willi Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. Sleep disturbances are common, but other symptoms are typically present from a young age. Symptoms can include:
- Excessive daytime sleepiness (common with the patient)
- Hypotonia (muscle weakness, not reported by the patient)
- Hyperphagia (excessive hunger or eating, not reported by the patient)
- Developmental delays (not reported by the patient)
- Physical features such as almond-shaped eyes and small hands/feet (not reported by the patient)

+5 Myotonic Dystrophy:
Myotonic dystrophy is a type of muscular dystrophy that affects muscle function. Sleep-related issues can be a part of the condition. Symptoms can include:
- Excessive daytime sleepiness (common with the patient)
- Myotonia (difficulty relaxing muscles, not reported by the patient)
- Muscle weakness (not reported by the patient)
- Cataracts (not reported by the patient)
- Cardiac conduction abnormalities (not reported by the patient)

Given the symptoms presented by the patient, the most likely diagnosis would be either narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia, as these conditions most closely match the patient's reported symptoms. Further diagnostic tests, such as a polysomnogram (sleep study) and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), would be helpful in distinguishing between these two conditions and confirming the diagnosis."
Amiloidosis sistémica primaria,"+1 Amyloidosis:
Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal protein, known as amyloid, builds up in tissues and organs. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, unexplained weight loss, shortness of breath, numbness and tingling in hands and feet, irregular heartbeats, swelling around the ankles, macroglossia (enlarged tongue), and purpuric skin rashes. Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) and high levels of protein in the blood and urine are also consistent with amyloidosis. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been specified, as the presented symptoms align well with the disease.

+2 Multiple Myeloma:
Multiple Myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells which can lead to an overproduction of abnormal proteins. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, unexplained weight loss, shortness of breath, numbness and tingling in hands and feet, and high levels of protein in the blood and urine. Irregular heartbeats and swelling around the ankles could also be related. However, macroglossia and purpuric skin rashes are not typical symptoms of multiple myeloma, and hepatomegaly is not a common finding.

+3 Polycythemia Vera:
Polycythemia Vera is a rare blood disorder in which the body makes too many red blood cells. This can lead to thickened blood and increased risk of clotting. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, shortness of breath, and irregular heartbeats. Symptoms not in common include unexplained weight loss, numbness and tingling in hands and feet, macroglossia, purpuric skin rashes, and hepatomegaly. High levels of protein in the blood and urine are also not typical for polycythemia vera.

+4 Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia:
Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by an excess of abnormal protein (macroglobulin) in the blood. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, weight loss, numbness and tingling in hands and feet, and high levels of protein in the blood and urine. Irregular heartbeats, swelling around the ankles, and hepatomegaly could also be seen in this condition. Macroglossia and purpuric skin rashes are less common but can occur. 

+5 Hereditary Hemochromatosis:
Hereditary Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron is then deposited in various organs, including the liver, causing damage. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, joint pain, and hepatomegaly. However, symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, shortness of breath, numbness and tingling in hands and feet, irregular heartbeats, swelling around the ankles, macroglossia, and purpuric skin rashes are not typical of hemochromatosis. High levels of protein in the blood and urine are also not a characteristic of this condition.

+6 Cardiac Amyloidosis:
Cardiac Amyloidosis is a disorder caused by deposits of amyloid protein in the heart tissue, leading to heart dysfunction. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeats, and swelling around the ankles. Macroglossia can sometimes be associated with this condition. High levels of protein in the blood and urine could be related to the amyloid deposits. Symptoms not in common include unexplained weight loss, numbness and tingling in hands and feet, and purpuric skin rashes, although these can be present in systemic amyloidosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and lab findings, further diagnostic tests such as a biopsy, imaging studies, and possibly genetic testing would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. It is important to approach the diagnosis with a comprehensive evaluation due to the overlap of symptoms among these rare diseases."
Hernia diafragmática congénita,"+1 Diaphragmatic Hernia:
A congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare condition where there is an abnormal opening in the diaphragm, allowing abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity, which can lead to respiratory distress due to lung compression. Symptoms in common with the patient include respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, and a barrel-shaped chest. Decreased breath sounds on one side of the chest could also be consistent with CDH. The prenatal finding of polyhydramnios and premature birth are also associated with CDH. However, the patient does not exhibit any symptoms that are explicitly not in common with CDH based on the information provided.

+2 Cystic Fibrosis:
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory and digestive systems. It is characterized by the production of thick mucus that can lead to respiratory distress and poor weight gain due to malabsorption. Symptoms in common with the patient include respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, and abnormal abdominal examination with decreased bowel sounds. However, a barrel-shaped chest is less typical in infancy with cystic fibrosis, and the family history is usually remarkable, which is not the case for this patient.

+3 Congenital Heart Disease:
There are various types of congenital heart diseases that can present with respiratory distress and feeding difficulties. Some forms may lead to poor weight gain and can be associated with a barrel-shaped chest due to heart enlargement. The decreased breath sounds could be related to fluid accumulation or structural abnormalities. However, the patient's symptoms do not include common signs of congenital heart disease such as cyanosis or heart murmurs, and the abnormal abdominal examination is not typical for congenital heart disease.

+4 Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia:
This rare genetic disorder affects the cilia lining the respiratory tract, leading to recurrent respiratory infections, which can cause respiratory distress and potentially impact feeding and growth. A barrel-shaped chest may develop due to chronic respiratory issues. However, the patient's symptoms do not include recurrent infections, which are typical for primary ciliary dyskinesia, and the prenatal history of polyhydramnios is not commonly associated with this condition.

+5 Jeune Syndrome (Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy):
Jeune syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a small chest that can lead to respiratory distress and a barrel-shaped chest appearance. It can also cause feeding difficulties and poor weight gain. The abnormal abdominal examination could be related to other organ involvement. However, the patient's symptoms do not include the short-limbed dwarfism typically associated with Jeune syndrome, and the family history is unremarkable, which is less common for this inherited condition.

+6 Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACD/MPV):
This rare congenital malformation affects the development of the lungs' blood vessels and can lead to severe respiratory distress, poor weight gain, and feeding difficulties. The decreased breath sounds on one side of the chest could be consistent with this condition. The prenatal finding of polyhydramnios and premature birth are also associated with ACD/MPV. However, the patient does not exhibit any symptoms that are explicitly not in common with ACD/MPV based on the information provided.

Please note that these are hypothetical diagnoses based on the symptoms provided, and actual diagnosis would require further medical testing and evaluation by a healthcare professional."
Canal aurículoventricular parcial,"+1 Eisenmenger Syndrome:
Eisenmenger syndrome is a rare condition that affects the heart and lungs. It is a complication of a long-standing heart defect that causes a left-to-right shunt, such as a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or atrial septal defect (ASD). Over time, this shunt can cause pulmonary hypertension and reversal of blood flow, leading to cyanosis and other symptoms. 
Common symptoms with the patient: Fatigue, shortness of breath, heart murmur, abnormalities in the heart structure, unusual blood flow pattern.
Symptoms not in common with the patient: Cyanosis (bluish coloration of the skin due to lack of oxygen), which was not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

+2 Congenital Heart Disease (CHD):
Congenital heart disease is a broad term for a range of birth defects that affect the normal workings of the heart. This can include structural defects, such as problems with the heart valves, walls, or blood vessels near the heart.
Common symptoms with the patient: Fatigue, shortness of breath, decreased physical stamina, heart murmur, abnormalities in the heart structure.
Symptoms not in common with the patient: Specific type of CHD not identified, as there are many forms of CHD, and not all symptoms may be present.

+3 Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD):
AVSD is a congenital heart defect that involves holes between the chambers of the heart and problems with the valves that regulate blood flow in the heart. It can affect the atrial and ventricular septa and the atrioventricular valves.
Common symptoms with the patient: Fatigue, shortness of breath, decreased physical stamina, heart murmur, abnormalities in the atrial and ventricular septa and the atrioventricular valves.
Symptoms not in common with the patient: Additional symptoms such as swelling of the legs or feet and poor weight gain in infants, which were not mentioned.

+4 Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD):
PCD is a rare genetic disorder that affects the cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures that line the airways, ears, and other parts of the body. This condition leads to chronic respiratory infections due to the inability to clear mucus effectively.
Common symptoms with the patient: Persistent respiratory infections.
Symptoms not in common with the patient: Other symptoms of PCD, such as situs inversus (reversed organs), chronic sinusitis, or ear infections, were not mentioned.

+5 Marfan Syndrome:
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. It can impact many parts of the body, including the heart, blood vessels, bones, joints, and eyes. Heart-related issues can include problems with the aorta and heart valves.
Common symptoms with the patient: Heart murmur, family history of similar health issues.
Symptoms not in common with the patient: Marfan syndrome is typically associated with features such as long limbs and fingers, which were not mentioned. Additionally, the specific heart valve abnormalities associated with Marfan syndrome may differ from those observed in the patient.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, it is important to consider a genetic component to her condition. Further genetic testing and consultation with a pediatric cardiologist and a geneticist may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan."
Tetralogía de Fallot,"+1 Tetralogy of Fallot:
Tetralogy of Fallot is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by four key features: a ventricular septal defect (a hole between the heart's lower chambers), pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve and outflow tract), right ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the muscular walls of the right ventricle), and an overriding aorta (where the aorta is positioned over the ventricular septal defect instead of the left ventricle). Symptoms in common with the patient include bluish skin discoloration (cyanosis), difficulty in breathing, a heart murmur, poor weight gain, fatigue, and a history of a possible heart defect noted on prenatal ultrasound. The squatting position is also a classic sign associated with Tetralogy of Fallot, as it can help increase blood flow to the lungs. Symptoms not in common: None reported.

+2 Eisenmenger Syndrome:
Eisenmenger syndrome is a long-term complication of a congenital heart defect that causes a left-to-right shunt between the heart chambers, such as a ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus. Over time, this shunt can cause pulmonary hypertension and reversal of the shunt flow to a right-to-left direction, leading to cyanosis. Symptoms in common with the patient include bluish skin discoloration, fatigue, and difficulty in breathing. Symptoms not in common: Eisenmenger syndrome typically develops later in life after prolonged shunt exposure, and the infant's age may not align with this diagnosis. Additionally, the squatting position is not as specifically associated with Eisenmenger syndrome as it is with Tetralogy of Fallot.

+3 Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR):
TAPVR is a rare congenital heart defect where all four pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Instead, they connect to the right atrium or to veins that drain into the right atrium, causing oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanosis, difficulty in breathing, and a heart murmur. Symptoms not in common: TAPVR is often associated with more severe symptoms shortly after birth, and the squatting position is not a typical behavior seen with this condition.

+4 Tricuspid Atresia:
Tricuspid atresia is a rare heart defect where the tricuspid valve, which lies between the right atrium and right ventricle, is not formed. As a result, blood cannot flow directly from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanosis, heart murmur, difficulty in breathing, and poor growth. Symptoms not in common: The squatting position is not specifically associated with tricuspid atresia, and additional symptoms or diagnostic tests would be needed to confirm this condition.

+5 Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS):
HLHS is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by underdevelopment of the left side of the heart. This leads to a severely underdeveloped left ventricle and aortic valve. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanosis, fatigue, difficulty in breathing, and a heart murmur. Symptoms not in common: The squatting position is not typically associated with HLHS, and the condition is usually identified shortly after birth due to severe symptoms.

Given the symptoms and medical history provided, Tetralogy of Fallot (+1) seems to be the most likely diagnosis for this patient. However, further diagnostic tests such as echocardiography, cardiac MRI, or cardiac catheterization would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to plan appropriate treatment."
Esofagitis eosinofílica,"+1 Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE):
Common Symptoms with Patient: Chronic heartburn, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, symptoms intensifying after eating certain foods, weight loss, atopic conditions (seasonal allergies, asthma), inflammation in the esophagus, higher than normal number of eosinophils in the esophagus.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: None reported, as the symptoms and endoscopy findings align well with EoE.

+2 Achalasia:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Difficulty swallowing, chest pain, weight loss.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Chronic heartburn is less typical in achalasia, and the presence of a higher than normal number of eosinophils in the esophagus is not characteristic of this condition.

+3 Celiac Disease:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Symptoms after eating wheat products, weight loss, atopic conditions.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Celiac disease typically does not cause high numbers of eosinophils in the esophagus, and heartburn is not a primary symptom.

+4 Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS):
Common Symptoms with Patient: Symptoms intensifying after eating wheat products, atopic conditions.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: NCGS is not typically associated with eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus or with difficulty swallowing.

+5 Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Weight loss, atopic conditions, higher than normal number of eosinophils (if present in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract as well).
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: The primary site of inflammation is not specified to be the esophagus, and heartburn is not a primary symptom.

+6 Lactose Intolerance:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Symptoms after eating dairy products.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Lactose intolerance does not cause eosinophilic inflammation, difficulty swallowing, or chronic heartburn.

+7 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):
Common Symptoms with Patient: Chronic heartburn, chest pain.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: GERD does not typically cause eosinophilic inflammation in the esophagus or result in weight loss.

Given the patient's symptoms and endoscopy findings, Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further testing and evaluation would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Deficiencia combinada no adquirida de hormonas hipofisarias,"+1 Acromegaly:
Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone, often due to a benign tumor. It typically causes enlarged hands and feet, coarsened facial features, and can lead to a variety of systemic symptoms. 
Common symptoms with the patient: Fatigue, change in facial structure, decreased libido, and headaches.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: The patient does not exhibit the typical enlargement of hands and feet, and there is no mention of coarsened facial features beyond changes in cheek and jaw structure.

+2 Hypothyroidism:
Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is underactive and does not produce enough thyroid hormones, leading to a slowdown in the body's metabolism.
Common symptoms with the patient: Fatigue, weight gain, feeling cold, constipation, decreased libido, and muscle weakness.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: The patient's reduction in body hair and changes in facial structure are not typical symptoms of hypothyroidism.

+3 Cushing's Syndrome:
Cushing's syndrome is caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol. It can result from taking glucocorticoid drugs or diseases that result in excess cortisol production by the adrenal glands.
Common symptoms with the patient: Fatigue, weight gain, decreased libido, rounder cheeks, decreased muscle strength, and reduction in body hair.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: The patient does not report other common signs such as a hump between the shoulders, purple stretch marks, or high blood pressure.

+4 Pituitary Adenoma:
A pituitary adenoma is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that can affect hormone production and cause a variety of symptoms depending on its size and the hormones affected.
Common symptoms with the patient: Fatigue, headaches, vision problems (specifically peripheral vision), and changes in facial structure.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: The patient does not exhibit symptoms such as hormonal overproduction (other than potential growth hormone excess) or menstrual irregularities, which would not be applicable in this male patient.

+5 Hypopituitarism:
Hypopituitarism is a rare disorder in which the pituitary gland fails to produce one or more of its hormones or not enough of them. This can lead to a variety of symptoms depending on which hormones are underproduced.
Common symptoms with the patient: Fatigue, decreased libido, muscle weakness, and reduction in body hair.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: The patient does not show other common symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, or anemia.

Given the symptoms presented, it would be prudent to conduct a thorough endocrine evaluation, including hormone level tests and potentially imaging studies, to further investigate the possibility of these and other conditions."
Oclusión de la vena central de la retina,"+1 Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis):
Giant cell arteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the arteries, most often the temporal arteries, which can lead to a sudden, painless loss of vision due to ischemia of the optic nerve. Symptoms in common with the patient include sudden vision loss and possibly a swollen optic disc. However, the patient does not report symptoms such as jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, or systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss, which are often associated with giant cell arteritis.

+2 Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO):
CRVO is a blockage of the central retinal vein, leading to a backup of blood and fluid in the retina. Symptoms in common with the patient include sudden, painless loss of vision, swollen optic disc, dilated and tortuous retinal veins, scattered retinal hemorrhages, and cotton wool spots. The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes are risk factors for CRVO.

+3 Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION):
NAION is caused by insufficient blood flow to the optic nerve, leading to optic nerve damage and sudden vision loss. Symptoms in common with the patient include sudden, painless loss of vision, a swollen optic disc, and a relative afferent pupillary defect. The patient's systemic conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, are risk factors for NAION. However, the presence of retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots is not typical for NAION.

+4 Diabetic Retinopathy:
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Symptoms in common with the patient include scattered retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, which are indicative of diabetic retinopathy. However, the sudden, painless loss of vision is not typical for diabetic retinopathy, which usually progresses gradually.

+5 Hypertensive Retinopathy:
Hypertensive retinopathy is damage to the retina and retinal circulation due to high blood pressure. Symptoms in common with the patient include findings on fundus examination such as retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. The patient's history of poorly controlled hypertension is a risk factor for this condition. However, the sudden loss of vision is less typical for hypertensive retinopathy, which usually develops over time.

+6 Retinal Artery Occlusion:
Retinal artery occlusion is a blockage of one of the arteries that carry blood to the retina. It can lead to sudden, painless vision loss. The patient's symptoms of sudden vision loss are in common with this condition. However, the fundus examination findings of dilated and tortuous retinal veins and scattered retinal hemorrhages are more characteristic of venous, rather than arterial, occlusion.

Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO). However, further diagnostic tests, such as fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. Immediate referral to an ophthalmologist is warranted for further evaluation and management."
Dermatitis herpetiforme,"+1 Dermatitis Herpetiformis:
Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic skin condition characterized by clusters of intensely itchy blisters and bumps. The rash is commonly located on the elbows, knees, and buttocks. It is associated with gluten sensitivity and celiac disease, and symptoms often improve with a gluten-free diet. The patient's symptoms of an itchy rash on the elbows, knees, and buttocks, as well as the improvement with a gluten-free diet, are consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis. The mild gastrointestinal discomfort, including bloating and intermittent diarrhea, could also be related to gluten sensitivity. However, the absence of significant weight loss is not typical for untreated celiac disease, which is often associated with this skin condition.

+2 Erythema Elevatum Diutinum:
Erythema elevatum diutinum is a rare type of chronic leukocytoclastic vasculitis that presents with red, purple, brown, or yellow papules, plaques, or nodules. These lesions are typically located on the extensor surfaces of the body, such as the knees and elbows. While the patient's rash on the elbows and knees could suggest this condition, the absence of the characteristic colors and the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms make this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, erythema elevatum diutinum is not known to improve with a gluten-free diet.

+3 Linear IgA Bullous Dermatosis:
This is a rare autoimmune blistering skin condition that can present with clusters of itchy blisters and bumps, often in a linear arrangement. It can affect various parts of the body, including the elbows, knees, and buttocks. The patient's symptoms of an itchy rash in these areas could be consistent with this disease. However, linear IgA bullous dermatosis is not typically associated with gastrointestinal symptoms or improvement with a gluten-free diet.

+4 Bullous Pemphigoid:
Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune skin disorder that typically presents with large, tense blisters on normal or inflamed skin. It is more common in older adults. The patient's chronic, intensely itchy rash and blisters could suggest bullous pemphigoid, but the rash in bullous pemphigoid is usually not as responsive to dietary changes like a gluten-free diet. Additionally, bullous pemphigoid does not typically present with gastrointestinal symptoms.

+5 Psoriasis:
Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that can cause red, scaly patches on the skin, often on the elbows, knees, and buttocks. While the patient does have a rash in these common psoriasis areas, the description of small red bumps and blisters is not typical for psoriasis. Moreover, psoriasis is not associated with gastrointestinal discomfort or improvement with a gluten-free diet.

Given the patient's symptoms and the improvement with a gluten-free diet, the most likely diagnosis from this list is Dermatitis Herpetiformis (+1). However, further testing, including skin biopsy and serological tests for celiac disease, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Retinosis pigmentaria,"+1 Retinitis Pigmentosa:
Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing at night and a loss of peripheral vision. Patients may also experience light sensitivity and the presence of flashes of light. The pigmentary changes in the retina with a bone spicule pattern are characteristic of RP. The patient's symptoms and family history align with this condition.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Progressive decline in vision
- Difficulty seeing at night
- Narrowing of peripheral vision (""tunnel vision"")
- Sensitivity to light
- Seeing flashes of light
- Pigmentary changes in the retina with a bone spicule pattern
- Ring of vision loss in the mid-periphery of the eyes

Symptoms Not Observed in Patient:
- None reported

+2 Usher Syndrome:
Usher syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects both hearing and vision. The vision loss is due to RP, which the patient appears to have, and it is often accompanied by hearing impairment. Patients with Usher syndrome typically have hearing loss from birth and begin to experience vision problems in adolescence or adulthood. The patient's symptoms match the vision-related aspects of Usher syndrome, but there is no mention of hearing loss.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Progressive decline in vision
- Difficulty seeing at night
- Narrowing of peripheral vision
- Sensitivity to light
- Seeing flashes of light
- Pigmentary changes in the retina with a bone spicule pattern

Symptoms Not Observed in Patient:
- Hearing loss (not mentioned)

+3 Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON):
LHON is a mitochondrial genetic disorder that leads to sudden vision loss, primarily in young adult males. The vision loss is central, leading to difficulty with detailed vision, but can also affect peripheral vision. It is less commonly associated with the pigmentary changes and bone spicule pattern seen in RP. The patient's symptoms do not fully align with LHON, as the onset is typically sudden rather than progressive.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Decline in vision

Symptoms Not Observed in Patient:
- Sudden vision loss
- Central vision loss
- Lack of pigmentary changes in the retina with a bone spicule pattern

+4 Stargardt Disease:
Stargardt disease is a form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration that causes progressive vision loss. The disease typically begins in childhood or adolescence and affects central vision, with peripheral vision usually remaining intact. It is characterized by the presence of flecks in the retina. The patient's symptoms do not fully match Stargardt disease, as the primary issue seems to be peripheral rather than central vision loss.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Progressive decline in vision

Symptoms Not Observed in Patient:
- Early onset in childhood or adolescence
- Central vision loss
- Presence of flecks in the retina

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, Retinitis Pigmentosa seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further genetic testing and a thorough clinical evaluation would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Enfermedad linfoproliferativa posttrasplante,"+1 Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD):
PTLD is a group of conditions that can occur in patients who have received an organ transplant and are on immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection. The disease is characterized by an abnormal increase in the number of lymphocytes, which can lead to lymphoma. Symptoms that the patient has in common with PTLD include fatigue, unexplained weight loss, night sweats, persistent fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and an abnormal increase in white blood cells. The biopsy suggesting abnormal proliferation of lymphocytes is also consistent with PTLD. Symptoms not in common have not been identified based on the provided information.

+2 Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD):
GVHD is a complication that can occur after a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, where the donated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells view the recipient's body as foreign and attack the body. While this condition is less common after a kidney transplant, it can still theoretically occur due to the presence of immune cells in the transplanted organ. Symptoms in common with the patient's presentation include fatigue, weight loss, and fever. However, GVHD typically presents with skin rashes, diarrhea, and jaundice, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

+3 Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH):
HLH is a rare disorder of the immune system primarily affecting children but can also occur in adults. It is characterized by an excessive, uncontrolled immune response. Common symptoms include fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, and elevated levels of triglycerides or ferritin. The patient's symptoms of persistent fever and hepatosplenomegaly are in common with HLH. However, HLH is also associated with neurological symptoms and a rash, which are not reported in this patient.

+4 Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML):
CMML is a rare type of cancer that affects blood cells and bone marrow. Patients with CMML may experience symptoms such as fatigue, fever, weight loss, and an increase in white blood cells, particularly monocytes. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, fever, and abnormal increase in white blood cells could be consistent with CMML. However, CMML is not typically associated with post-transplant complications and does not usually present with lymphadenopathy or a proliferation of lymphocytes as suggested by the biopsy.

+5 Castleman disease:
Castleman disease is a rare disorder characterized by non-cancerous growths that can develop in the lymph node tissue. It can present with symptoms such as fatigue, fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, fever, and lymphadenopathy are in common with Castleman disease. However, Castleman disease is not directly related to immunosuppressive therapy or organ transplantation.

Given the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis appears to be Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), as it is directly related to the patient's immunosuppressive therapy and organ transplant history. Further diagnostic tests, including a thorough examination of the biopsy and possibly imaging studies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan."
Tumor glial,"+1 Schwannomatosis:
Schwannomatosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple schwannomas, which are tumors of the nerve sheath, throughout the nervous system, except on the vestibular nerve. Symptoms can include pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected areas, and less commonly, headaches and seizures. Cognitive difficulties are not a typical symptom of schwannomatosis.
- Common symptoms: Headaches, seizures.
- Uncommon symptoms: Cognitive difficulties, no genetic predisposition noted.

+2 Gliomatosis Cerebri:
Gliomatosis cerebri is a rare and aggressive brain tumor that involves the glial cells, which provide support and nutrition for the nervous system. It is characterized by the diffuse infiltration of tumor cells across multiple regions of the brain, leading to symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and cognitive difficulties. This condition is difficult to treat and often requires a combination of therapies.
- Common symptoms: Headaches, seizures, cognitive difficulties.
- Uncommon symptoms: The patient's abnormal cell growth is within the supportive tissue, which aligns with gliomatosis cerebri, but the lack of genetic predisposition and the patient's lifestyle factors are not typically associated with this disease.

+3 Meningioma:
Meningioma is a tumor that arises from the meninges, the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. While most meningiomas are benign, they can cause symptoms if they grow large enough to press on the brain or spinal cord. Symptoms can include headaches, seizures, and cognitive difficulties. Meningiomas are not typically associated with genetic predispositions and can occur in individuals with no family history of the disease.
- Common symptoms: Headaches, seizures, cognitive difficulties.
- Uncommon symptoms: The patient's tumor is within the supportive tissue, which could be consistent with a meningioma, but the description does not specify the meninges as the origin.

+4 Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2):
NF2 is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of noncancerous tumors in the nervous system, particularly schwannomas affecting the vestibular nerve. Patients may experience headaches, seizures, and cognitive issues due to the presence of tumors. However, NF2 is typically inherited, and the patient has no known genetic predispositions.
- Common symptoms: Headaches, seizures, cognitive difficulties.
- Uncommon symptoms: No genetic predisposition noted, and the patient's symptoms do not specifically mention issues with hearing or balance, which are common in NF2.

+5 Anaplastic Astrocytoma:
Anaplastic astrocytoma is a rare and malignant brain tumor that originates from astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the brain. It is characterized by rapid growth and can cause symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and cognitive difficulties. Treatment often involves surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
- Common symptoms: Headaches, seizures, cognitive difficulties.
- Uncommon symptoms: The patient's lifestyle and lack of genetic predisposition are not typical factors associated with anaplastic astrocytoma, but the symptoms and treatment align with this diagnosis.

Given the symptoms and the presence of abnormal cell growth within the supportive tissue of the nervous system, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be Gliomatosis Cerebri or Anaplastic Astrocytoma. However, a definitive diagnosis would require further pathological examination of the tumor tissue, possibly including a biopsy, to determine the exact type of cells involved."
Enfermedad por citomegalovirus (CMV) en pacientes de riesgo por inmunidad celular alterada,"+1 Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID):
CVID is a disorder that impairs the immune system. People with CVID are highly susceptible to infections from various microorganisms. Symptoms can include persistent fever, fatigue, and weight loss, which align with the patient's symptoms. However, CVID is typically associated with recurrent infections, particularly in the lungs, sinuses, and ears, as well as gastrointestinal tract infections, which have not been specified in the patient's symptoms. Blood tests in CVID patients may show low levels of immunoglobulins.

+2 Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID):
SCID is a group of rare, sometimes fatal, congenital disorders characterized by little or no immune response. The main symptom is a severe deficiency in both T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, leading to frequent and severe infections. Persistent fever and weight loss are common symptoms, which the patient has. However, SCID is usually diagnosed in infancy due to severe and life-threatening infections, which does not seem to be the case with the current patient group.

+3 Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome:
This is a rare X-linked recessive disease characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), immune deficiency, and blood in the stool. Patients with Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome are prone to infections because of their compromised immune system. The patient's symptoms of persistent fever and weight loss could be seen in this condition. However, the syndrome is usually identified in childhood and is accompanied by bleeding issues due to low platelet counts, which is not mentioned among the patient's symptoms.

+4 Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD):
CGD is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system. Individuals with CGD are unable to fight off certain types of bacteria and fungi, leading to chronic inflammation and the formation of granulomas. The patient's symptoms of persistent fever and fatigue could be associated with CGD. However, CGD typically presents with recurrent infections, such as pneumonia, abscesses, and skin infections, which are not specified in the patient's symptoms.

+5 X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA):
XLA is a condition that affects the body's ability to produce antibodies, leading to an increased susceptibility to infections. Patients with XLA often experience persistent infections, fever, and fatigue, which are symptoms the patient has. However, XLA is usually diagnosed in early childhood and is characterized by very low levels of immunoglobulins in the blood, which is not detailed in the patient's current blood tests.

+6 Hyper IgM Syndrome:
This is a rare immunodeficiency disorder characterized by normal or high levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) with absent or low levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin E (IgE). Patients with Hyper IgM Syndrome are susceptible to a variety of infections, including those that are opportunistic. The patient's symptoms of persistent fever and fatigue could be indicative of this syndrome. However, the syndrome also typically includes symptoms such as chronic diarrhea and opportunistic infections, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

+7 Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS):
ALPS is a disorder in which the body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells (lymphocytes). This leads to lymphoproliferation, causing enlargement of lymph nodes and spleen, and can result in autoimmune problems. Patients may experience fever and fatigue, which the patient has. However, ALPS is also associated with autoimmune cytopenias, which are not described in the patient's symptoms.

Please note that these are potential rare diseases based on the symptoms provided, and further medical evaluation, including detailed patient history, physical examination, and additional laboratory tests, would be necessary to make an accurate diagnosis."
Hemiagenesia tiroidea,"+1 Hypothyroidism:
Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. Symptoms the patient has in common with this disease include fatigue, unexplained weight gain, and cold intolerance. The family history of thyroid disorders also supports this potential diagnosis. However, the asymmetry in the neck is not a typical presentation of hypothyroidism, which usually involves a uniformly enlarged thyroid (goiter) if there is a physical change to the thyroid gland.

+2 Hashimoto's Thyroiditis:
Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder that can lead to hypothyroidism. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance are consistent with this condition. The family history of thyroid disorders is also a common feature. The physical examination finding of an asymmetrical neck could suggest the presence of thyroid nodules or an unevenly enlarged thyroid, which can occur in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. However, this would need to be confirmed with further testing, such as thyroid function tests and ultrasound.

+3 Cushing's Syndrome:
Cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol. While the patient's weight gain could be a symptom of Cushing's syndrome, the other symptoms such as fatigue and cold intolerance are not typical of this condition. Additionally, Cushing's syndrome often presents with other signs such as a round face, a fat lump between the shoulders, and skin changes, which the patient does not report.

+4 Sheehan's Syndrome:
Sheehan's syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged due to severe blood loss during childbirth. The patient's symptoms of fatigue and weight gain could be related to pituitary dysfunction. However, the patient's age and the lack of mention of a recent pregnancy or childbirth make this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, Sheehan's syndrome typically presents with a history of postpartum hemorrhage.

+5 Addison's Disease:
Addison's disease is a disorder that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. Symptoms can include fatigue and weight gain, but patients with Addison's disease often experience weight loss instead. Cold intolerance is not a typical symptom of Addison's disease. The patient's family history of endocrine abnormalities could be relevant, but the asymmetry in the neck is not associated with Addison's disease.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely diagnosis to consider first would be a thyroid disorder, such as hypothyroidism or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Further diagnostic testing, including thyroid function tests and thyroid ultrasound, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Sindactilia tipo 1,"+1 Apert Syndrome:
Apert syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones, which affects the shape of the head and face. Patients with Apert syndrome also typically have syndactyly, which is the fusion of fingers and toes. Symptoms in common with the patient: fusion of fingers and toes. Symptoms not in common: abnormal head and face shape, as no craniofacial abnormalities were mentioned.

+2 Poland Syndrome:
Poland syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by the underdevelopment or absence of the chest muscle on one side of the body and usually also includes webbing of the fingers (cutaneous syndactyly) of the hand on the same side. Symptoms in common with the patient: webbing of fingers. Symptoms not in common: underdevelopment or absence of the chest muscle on one side, as no such asymmetry was reported.

+3 Syndactyly:
Syndactyly is a condition where two or more fingers or toes are fused together. It can vary from incomplete to complete fusion and can involve the bones or just the skin. Symptoms in common with the patient: fusion of fingers and toes. Symptoms not in common: none, as syndactyly directly describes the patient's condition without additional unrelated symptoms.

+4 Holt-Oram Syndrome:
Holt-Oram syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause abnormalities in the bones of the arms and hands, as well as heart problems. Symptoms in common with the patient: hand anomalies. Symptoms not in common: heart problems, as the patient's vital signs are normal and no heart issues were mentioned.

+5 Carpenter Syndrome:
Carpenter syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of skull bones, differences in the fingers and toes, obesity, and other abnormalities. Symptoms in common with the patient: differences in fingers and toes. Symptoms not in common: premature fusion of skull bones, obesity, and other abnormalities not specified in the patient's presentation.

Given the patient's symptoms, a more detailed genetic and possibly radiographic evaluation would be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. It is important to consider the possibility of a genetic syndrome given the presence of syndactyly without a family history, and a referral to a geneticist may be warranted for further assessment and counseling."
Penfigoide ampolloso,"'+1' Pemphigoid Bullous:
This autoimmune disorder is characterized by large, fluid-filled blisters that develop on areas of the skin that often flex, such as the lower abdomen, upper thighs, and arms. The blisters of bullous pemphigoid are usually tense and do not rupture easily, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. Itching is also a common symptom. However, bullous pemphigoid typically occurs in older individuals, which matches the patient's age profile. The patient's mucous membranes not being affected is also consistent with bullous pemphigoid, as this condition usually spares the mucous membranes. Fatigue and weight loss are not typical symptoms of bullous pemphigoid, but they could be related to the patient's overall health status or other conditions.

'+2' Dermatitis Herpetiformis:
This chronic skin condition is characterized by clusters of intensely itchy blisters and hives, primarily on the elbows, knees, back, and buttocks. While the patient does have itching and blisters, dermatitis herpetiformis is typically associated with gluten sensitivity and celiac disease, and the distribution of lesions is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Additionally, the patient's age is not typical for the onset of dermatitis herpetiformis, and mucous membranes are not involved in this condition.

'+3' Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita:
This rare autoimmune disorder is characterized by the formation of blisters at the site of minor trauma and can affect both skin and mucous membranes. However, the patient's mucous membranes are not affected, which is not typical for epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. The age of the patient and the presence of tense blisters could be consistent with this condition, but the lack of trauma history and mucous membrane involvement makes this diagnosis less likely.

'+4' Porphyria Cutanea Tarda:
This condition is a type of porphyria that leads to blistering skin lesions on sun-exposed areas, which can be exacerbated by factors such as alcohol, certain medications, and hepatitis C. The patient's lesions are not described as being in sun-exposed areas, and there is no mention of these exacerbating factors. Additionally, porphyria cutanea tarda often presents with skin fragility and blistering that heals with scarring and milia, which is not described in the patient's presentation.

'+5' Linear IgA Dermatosis:
This autoimmune blistering disease is characterized by the linear deposition of IgA at the basement membrane zone, leading to the development of tense blisters. It can affect both children and adults and may present with blisters on the trunk and extremities, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. However, the absence of mucous membrane involvement and the patient's age may make this diagnosis less likely.

Given the patient's age, the presence of tense, large blisters on the lower abdomen and upper thighs, severe itching, and the absence of mucous membrane involvement, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be '+1' Bullous Pemphigoid. However, further diagnostic tests, such as a skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Alopecia universal,"+1 Alopecia Universalis:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Complete loss of hair on the scalp, face, and body, including eyebrows and eyelashes.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Often associated with other autoimmune disorders, which the patient does not have. Patients may also experience nail changes, which this patient does not have.

+2 Ectodermal Dysplasia:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Can sometimes lead to abnormalities in hair growth, potentially resulting in total hair loss.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Typically presents with a range of other symptoms affecting the skin, teeth, and nails, which the patient does not exhibit.

+3 Hypotrichosis Simplex:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Progressive hair loss leading to a reduced amount of hair on the scalp and body.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Usually becomes apparent in childhood or early adulthood, not typically starting as late as age 30.

+4 Lichen Planopilaris:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Can lead to scarring hair loss on the scalp.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Often accompanied by itching, redness, and pain, which the patient does not report. It is also not usually associated with the loss of eyebrows, eyelashes, and body hair.

+5 Mycosis Fungoides (Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma):
Common Symptoms with Patient: Can cause alopecia in advanced stages.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Usually presents with skin patches, plaques, or tumors, and the patient does not report any other skin conditions.

+6 Anagen Effluvium:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Rapid hair loss from the scalp and body.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Typically caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy, which the patient has not undergone.

+7 Telogen Effluvium:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Diffuse hair thinning over the scalp.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Generally does not result in complete baldness and is often reversible, unlike the patient's condition.

+8 Congenital Atrichia:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Absence of hair on the scalp and body.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: This condition is apparent from birth, which does not align with the patient's onset of symptoms at age 30.

Given the patient's symptoms and the absence of other associated conditions, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be Alopecia Universalis. However, further tests, including a thorough clinical examination, blood tests, and possibly a scalp biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Trombocitopenia inmune,"+1 Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome:
Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disease, which typically presents in males, characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), immune deficiency, and recurrent infections. The patient's symptoms of recurrent nosebleeds, excessive menstruation, and unexplained bruises could be related to thrombocytopenia. However, the absence of a family history of blood-related disorders, the patient being female, and the lack of reported immune deficiency or eczema make this diagnosis less likely.

+2 Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP):
Immune Thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a low platelet count leading to easy bruising, bleeding gums, nosebleeds, and petechiae. The patient's symptoms of recurrent nosebleeds, excessive menstruation, unexplained bruises, and low platelet count are consistent with ITP. The absence of a family history is also common in ITP, as it is not typically inherited. The patient's past viral infection could be a contributing factor, as ITP can be triggered by infections.

+3 Glanzmann Thrombasthenia:
Glanzmann Thrombasthenia is a rare genetic platelet disorder that results in the inability of platelets to properly clot blood. Symptoms include nosebleeds, gum bleeding, heavy menstrual periods, and easy bruising. The patient's symptoms align with this condition; however, Glanzmann Thrombasthenia is usually diagnosed in childhood and has a genetic component, which the patient does not report.

+4 Bernard-Soulier Syndrome:
Bernard-Soulier Syndrome is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by abnormally large platelets, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged bleeding times. Symptoms often include nosebleeds, easy bruising, and heavy menstrual bleeding. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this syndrome, but the lack of family history and the fact that it is usually diagnosed early in life make this diagnosis less likely.

+5 Von Willebrand Disease:
Von Willebrand Disease is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of von Willebrand factor, which helps platelets to stick together and form clots. Symptoms can include heavy menstrual periods, easy bruising, and nosebleeds. The patient's symptoms could suggest this disease; however, von Willebrand Disease is often associated with a family history of bleeding disorders, which the patient does not have.

+6 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP):
TTP is a rare blood disorder characterized by blood clots forming in small blood vessels throughout the body, leading to a low platelet count. Symptoms include bruising, petechiae, purpura, fatigue, and neurological symptoms such as blurred vision. The patient's symptoms are consistent with TTP, and the absence of a family history does not rule it out, as TTP can occur without a genetic predisposition.

+7 Aplastic Anemia:
Aplastic Anemia is a rare condition where the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells, including platelets. Symptoms can include fatigue, unexplained bruising, nosebleeds, and skin rashes like petechiae and purpura. The patient's low platelet count and symptoms match aplastic anemia; however, the condition typically also involves low red and white blood cell counts, which is not mentioned in the patient's lab results.

Given the patient's symptoms and lab results, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, further testing and evaluation would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Narcolepsia tipo 1,"+1 Narcolepsy Type 1:
Narcolepsy Type 1 is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Patients often experience cataplexy, which is a sudden, brief loss of voluntary muscle tone triggered by strong emotions. Symptoms in common with the patient include excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hallucinations at sleep onset or upon awakening, and disrupted nighttime sleep. This condition does not typically involve a prior record of neurological or psychiatric disorders, which aligns with the patient's history.

+2 Kleine-Levin Syndrome:
Kleine-Levin Syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by recurring episodes of excessive sleep (hypersomnia), altered behavior, and a reduced understanding of the world. While the patient does have excessive daytime sleepiness, the syndrome is also associated with cognitive and mood disturbances, which the patient has not reported. Additionally, the episodes of Kleine-Levin Syndrome are periodic and not continuous, which does not seem to match the patient's symptoms.

+3 Idiopathic Hypersomnia:
Idiopathic Hypersomnia is a sleep disorder causing chronic excessive daytime sleepiness that usually does not include cataplexy. Patients often have difficulty waking up after sleeping (sleep inertia) and may have long sleep times. The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness and disrupted nighttime sleep are in common with this disorder. However, the presence of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations are not typical features of Idiopathic Hypersomnia.

+4 Multiple System Atrophy (MSA):
Multiple System Atrophy is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of symptoms affecting movement, blood pressure, and other bodily functions. It may include sleep disturbances such as REM sleep behavior disorder, which can cause dream enactment behaviors, but it does not typically present with cataplexy, sleep paralysis, or hallucinations. Additionally, MSA usually presents with autonomic dysfunction and motor impairment, which the patient does not report.

+5 REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD):
REM Sleep Behavior Disorder involves the acting out of dreams due to a lack of muscle paralysis during REM sleep. While the patient does experience disrupted nighttime sleep, the key symptoms of RBD are not in line with the patient's reported experiences. The patient has sleep paralysis (which is the opposite of the lack of muscle atonia seen in RBD) and does not report any dream enactment behaviors.

+6 Hypocretin (Orexin) Deficiency:
This is a condition where there is a deficiency of hypocretin, a neurotransmitter that regulates arousal, wakefulness, and appetite. The symptoms can include excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, which are present in the patient's case. However, this condition is often specifically associated with Narcolepsy Type 1, and testing for hypocretin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid can confirm the diagnosis.

Given the patient's symptoms, Narcolepsy Type 1 appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, including a polysomnogram (overnight sleep study) and a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. It is also important to consider a thorough medical history and physical examination to exclude other potential causes of the patient's symptoms."
Colangitis biliar primaria,"+1 Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC):
PBC is a chronic disease that slowly destroys the bile ducts in the liver. Symptoms the patient has in common with PBC include persistent fatigue, pruritus, increased skin pigmentation, discomfort in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, and signs of jaundice. The patient's history of autoimmune disorders and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels also align with PBC. Symptoms not in common with the patient's presentation are not specified, as the provided information fits well with PBC.

+2 Hemochromatosis:
Hemochromatosis is a condition where the body absorbs too much iron from the diet, leading to iron overload. Symptoms the patient has in common with hemochromatosis include increased skin pigmentation, liver enlargement, and fatigue. However, pruritus is not a typical symptom of hemochromatosis, and the patient's blood tests would need to show elevated iron levels for this diagnosis to be more likely.

+3 Autoimmune Hepatitis:
Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic condition in which the body's immune system attacks the liver, causing inflammation and damage. Symptoms the patient has in common with autoimmune hepatitis include fatigue, liver enlargement, jaundice, and a history of autoimmune disorders. The elevated liver enzymes could also be indicative of this condition. However, pruritus and increased skin pigmentation are not as commonly associated with autoimmune hepatitis.

+4 Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC):
PSC is a chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts. Symptoms the patient has in common with PSC include fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, and liver enlargement. The elevated alkaline phosphatase level is also consistent with PSC. However, PSC is more common in males and is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

+5 Wilson's Disease:
Wilson's Disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. Symptoms the patient has in common with Wilson's Disease include liver enlargement, fatigue, and potentially increased skin pigmentation (although this is usually more copper-colored). The patient's elevated liver enzymes could also be a sign of Wilson's Disease. However, the patient would typically present with neurological symptoms, and a key diagnostic feature would be a low serum ceruloplasmin level, which is not mentioned here.

+6 Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT):
PCT is a type of porphyria that affects the skin and liver. Symptoms the patient has in common with PCT include pruritus, increased skin pigmentation, and liver abnormalities. However, PCT is also characterized by blistering skin lesions, especially on sun-exposed areas, which the patient does not report. Elevated liver enzymes can be seen in PCT, but other specific tests would be needed for diagnosis.

Please note that these are hypothetical considerations based on the symptoms provided, and a thorough clinical evaluation, including additional laboratory tests and imaging, would be necessary to reach an accurate diagnosis."
Enfermedad de Charcot-MarieTooth/Neuropatía sensitivo-motora hereditaria,"+1 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT):
CMT is a group of inherited disorders that affect the peripheral nerves. It is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, particularly in the lower extremities, which can lead to foot drop and an ""inverted champagne bottle"" appearance of the legs. Sensory loss, including decreased sensitivity to temperature and touch, is also common. The patient's symptoms of muscle weakness and atrophy, foot drop, sensory loss, and family history are consistent with CMT. However, further testing, including genetic testing and nerve conduction studies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

+2 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA):
SMA is a genetic disorder that affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle wasting and weakness. The symptoms can include muscle weakness and atrophy, particularly in the proximal muscles closer to the center of the body. The patient's symptoms of muscle weakness and atrophy in the lower extremities could suggest SMA, but the pattern of weakness and the sensory loss he is experiencing are less typical for SMA. Additionally, SMA usually presents earlier in life and may not show a progressive history over several years.

+3 Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy (HMSN):
HMSN, also known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, is a group of disorders that affect the peripheral nerves. It includes various types, all of which can cause muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, and foot deformities. The patient's symptoms and family history align with HMSN. As mentioned earlier, genetic testing and nerve conduction studies would help in differentiating the specific type of HMSN.

+4 Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP):
FAP is a rare inherited disorder caused by the deposition of amyloid proteins in tissues and organs, including peripheral nerves. It can lead to sensory loss, autonomic dysfunction, and muscle weakness. The patient's symptoms of sensory loss and muscle weakness could be seen in FAP, but other common symptoms of FAP, such as autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal disturbances), are not mentioned. Additionally, FAP often has other systemic symptoms that are not reported by the patient.

+5 Distal Hereditary Motor Neuropathy (dHMN):
dHMN is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle atrophy and weakness, predominantly in the distal muscles of the lower limbs. It can lead to foot drop and an ""inverted champagne bottle"" appearance. While the patient's symptoms of muscle weakness and atrophy, and foot drop are consistent with dHMN, the sensory loss he is experiencing is not typical for this condition, as dHMN primarily affects motor neurons.

+6 Kennedy's Disease (Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy):
Kennedy's Disease is an X-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder that affects males. It is characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. The patient's symptoms of muscle weakness and atrophy could suggest Kennedy's Disease, but it is also associated with other signs such as bulbar symptoms (difficulty swallowing, speaking), which are not reported by the patient. Additionally, sensory involvement is not a typical feature of Kennedy's Disease.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, a thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed neurological examination, electrophysiological studies, and genetic testing, would be essential to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential rare diseases."
Síndrome de cáncer de mama y ovario hereditario,"+1 Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC):
This syndrome is associated with mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. The patient's familial history of breast and ovarian cancer, with several cases occurring at relatively young ages, aligns with the pattern seen in HBOC. The presence of a BRCA1 gene mutation further supports this potential diagnosis. The patient's early menarche and nulliparity (never being pregnant) are also risk factors for breast cancer, although they are not specific to HBOC. The patient does not report any current symptoms, which is not uncommon as HBOC increases risk over time rather than presenting with immediate symptoms.

+2 Li-Fraumeni Syndrome:
This rare inherited disorder greatly increases the risk of developing several types of cancer, often at a young age. It is typically caused by mutations in the TP53 gene. While the patient's family history is suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome, the absence of a wider variety of cancers at young ages makes Li-Fraumeni less likely. The patient does not report a TP53 mutation, nor does she present with cancers commonly associated with Li-Fraumeni, such as sarcomas, brain tumors, or adrenocortical carcinomas.

+3 Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome:
This condition is characterized by the development of benign polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of various cancers, including breast and ovarian cancer. It is caused by mutations in the STK11 gene. The patient's family history and BRCA1 mutation do not align with the typical genetic findings in Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome. Additionally, the patient does not report the mucocutaneous pigmentation or polyps that are hallmarks of this syndrome.

+4 Cowden Syndrome (PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome):
Cowden Syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with mutations in the PTEN gene, leading to multiple noncancerous, tumor-like growths called hamartomas and an increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers. The patient's family history of breast and ovarian cancer could be consistent with Cowden Syndrome; however, the patient does not report a PTEN mutation or the presence of hamartomas, thyroid issues, or other symptoms typical of Cowden Syndrome.

+5 Lynch Syndrome (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer, HNPCC):
Lynch Syndrome is an inherited condition associated with a high risk of colorectal cancer as well as other cancers, including ovarian and endometrial cancer. It is caused by mutations in genes responsible for DNA mismatch repair, such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM. While the patient's family history includes ovarian cancer, the absence of colorectal or endometrial cancers in the family history and the lack of reported mismatch repair gene mutations make this diagnosis less likely. The patient also does not report any symptoms associated with Lynch Syndrome, such as colorectal polyps or cancers.

Given the patient's genetic testing results and family history, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC) is the most likely diagnosis. It is important to note that while the patient does not currently exhibit symptoms, her increased risk warrants careful monitoring and consideration of risk-reducing strategies."
Glaucoma neovascular,"+1 Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON):
LHON is a mitochondrial genetic disorder that leads to sudden vision loss, typically in young adults. However, it can present later in life, particularly in rare cases. 
Common symptoms with the patient: Progressive vision loss, more severe in one eye.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: Typically presents in young adults, sudden rather than progressive vision loss, no mention of diabetes or hypertension as related factors.

+2 Retinitis Pigmentosa:
This is a group of genetic disorders that affect the retina's ability to respond to light, leading to a progressive loss of vision.
Common symptoms with the patient: Progressive vision loss, difficulty adjusting from light to dark (night blindness), tunnel vision.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: Usually diagnosed earlier in life, not typically associated with eye redness or pain.

+3 Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma:
The most common form of glaucoma, this condition leads to progressive vision loss due to damage to the optic nerve, often associated with increased intraocular pressure.
Common symptoms with the patient: Progressive vision loss, tunnel-like vision, increased sensitivity to light, and halos around lights.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: Glaucoma is often asymptomatic until advanced stages; pain is not typically a feature.

+4 Diabetic Retinopathy:
A complication of diabetes that affects the eyes, it's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).
Common symptoms with the patient: Progressive vision loss, diabetes history, possibly the darkening of vision.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: Diabetic retinopathy usually does not cause eye redness or pain.

+5 Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD):
AMD is a disease that blurs the sharp, central vision you need for ""straight-ahead"" activities such as reading and driving. It affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail.
Common symptoms with the patient: Progressive vision loss, difficulty adjusting to low light, family history of late-onset vision disorders.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: AMD typically affects central vision first, not peripheral vision, and does not usually cause eye redness or pain.

+6 Usher Syndrome:
A rare genetic disorder that affects both hearing and vision, leading to hearing loss and an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa.
Common symptoms with the patient: Progressive vision loss, tunnel vision, difficulty in low light conditions.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: Usher syndrome also involves hearing loss, which the patient has not reported.

Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, further diagnostic tests such as a comprehensive eye examination, visual field testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and possibly genetic testing would be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan."
Craneosinostosis,"+1 Craniosynostosis:
Craniosynostosis is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses by turning into bone, thereby changing the growth pattern of the skull. Because the skull cannot expand perpendicular to the fused suture, it grows more in the parallel direction. In this case, the patient's long, narrow head with a prominent, pointed forehead suggests a condition known as sagittal synostosis, a type of craniosynostosis where the sagittal suture—the suture located at the top of the head—fuses prematurely. Symptoms in common: unusual head shape, prominent forehead, prematurely fused cranial sutures. Symptoms not in common: no other physical abnormalities noted, normal development.

+2 Apert Syndrome:
Apert Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones, leading to a distorted shape of the head and face. In addition to craniosynostosis, individuals with Apert Syndrome typically have syndactyly (fusion of fingers and toes) and other skeletal abnormalities. Symptoms in common: unusual head shape, prematurely fused cranial sutures. Symptoms not in common: no syndactyly or other skeletal abnormalities noted, no family history reported.

+3 Crouzon Syndrome:
Crouzon Syndrome is another genetic disorder that leads to the premature fusion of skull bones. This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. People with Crouzon Syndrome often have wide-set, bulging eyes and a beaked nose due to the midface hypoplasia. Symptoms in common: unusual head shape, prematurely fused cranial sutures. Symptoms not in common: no eye or nose abnormalities noted, no family history reported.

+4 Pfeiffer Syndrome:
Pfeiffer Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones, which affects the shape of the head and face. It also involves broad, short thumbs and toes, and partial soft tissue syndactyly. There are three subtypes of Pfeiffer Syndrome, with varying degrees of severity. Symptoms in common: unusual head shape, prematurely fused cranial sutures. Symptoms not in common: no broad, short thumbs and toes, no soft tissue syndactyly, no family history reported.

Given the symptoms presented, the most likely diagnosis for the patient would be Craniosynostosis, specifically sagittal synostosis. However, genetic testing and further evaluation by a specialist in pediatric genetics or neurosurgery would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other syndromic causes. Treatment often involves surgery to correct the shape of the head and allow for normal brain growth. Early intervention is crucial to prevent potential complications such as increased intracranial pressure and developmental delays."
Atresia de esófago,"+1 Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) with esophageal atresia:
This is a congenital defect where there is an abnormal connection (fistula) between the esophagus and the trachea, and the esophagus may also end in a blind pouch rather than connecting to the stomach. Symptoms in common: feeding difficulties, coughing and choking during feeding, episodes of cyanosis, recurrent pneumonia. Symptoms not in common: the presence of a gap in the middle of the chest is not typical for TEF with esophageal atresia.

+2 Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH):
CDH is a birth defect where there is an abnormal opening in the diaphragm, allowing abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity, which can cause respiratory distress and feeding difficulties. Symptoms in common: feeding difficulties, cyanosis, small birth weight, and potentially the gap in the middle of the chest if it is related to a herniation of abdominal contents. Symptoms not in common: excessive drooling and inability to swallow are not typical symptoms of CDH, and recurrent pneumonia is less common.

+3 Pierre Robin sequence:
This is a condition characterized by a smaller-than-normal lower jaw (micrognathia), a tongue that is placed further back than normal (glossoptosis), and may include a cleft palate. These features can lead to feeding and breathing difficulties. Symptoms in common: feeding difficulties, episodes of cyanosis, and possibly the gap in the middle of the chest if it is related to a cleft. Symptoms not in common: excessive drooling is not specific, and recurrent pneumonia is not a primary symptom.

+4 Choanal atresia:
This is a congenital condition where the back of the nasal passage (choana) is blocked, typically by abnormal bony or soft tissue, leading to difficulty breathing, especially when feeding. Symptoms in common: feeding difficulties, episodes of cyanosis, and possibly excessive drooling due to difficulty swallowing. Symptoms not in common: the gap in the middle of the chest is not associated with choanal atresia, and recurrent pneumonia is not a primary symptom.

+5 Esophageal atresia without tracheoesophageal fistula:
This is a condition where the esophagus does not form properly and ends in a blind pouch, which can cause feeding difficulties and choking. Symptoms in common: feeding difficulties, coughing and choking during feeding, inability to swallow, excessive drooling. Symptoms not in common: the gap in the middle of the chest is not typical for this condition, and recurrent pneumonia is less common without a fistula.

+6 Pentalogy of Cantrell:
This is a rare condition that involves five anomalies: a defect in the abdominal wall (omphalocele), a defect in the lower sternum, a deficiency of the anterior diaphragm, a defect in the diaphragmatic pericardium, and congenital heart anomalies. Symptoms in common: the gap in the middle of the chest could be related to the sternal defect, feeding difficulties, and possibly cyanosis if there are associated heart anomalies. Symptoms not in common: excessive drooling and recurrent pneumonia are not specific to this condition.

Given the symptoms presented, it is important to conduct further diagnostic tests such as imaging studies (e.g., chest X-ray, echocardiogram) and possibly genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment."
Transposición no corregida congénitamente de las grandes arterias,"+1 Tetralogy of Fallot:
This congenital heart defect is characterized by four key features: a ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. Symptoms that match the patient include cyanotic episodes, history of poor feeding, easy fatigability, and frequent respiratory infections. The presence of a single loud second heart sound and a systolic ejection murmur are also consistent with this condition. The abnormal positioning of the heart's two main arteries could be related to the overriding aorta. Symptoms not mentioned that are commonly associated with Tetralogy of Fallot include spells of very deep cyanosis (Tet spells), but these could be similar to the cyanotic episodes the patient is experiencing.

+2 Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA):
In this condition, the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed, which causes oxygen-poor blood to circulate to the body and oxygen-rich blood to circulate within the lungs. The patient's diagnostic imaging showing abnormal positioning of the heart's two main arteries is consistent with TGA. Symptoms in common include cyanotic episodes since birth and poor growth. However, the presence of a systolic ejection murmur is not typically associated with TGA, as this condition usually presents with a single, loud second heart sound but no murmur.

+3 Tricuspid Atresia:
This is a form of congenital heart disease where the tricuspid heart valve is absent or abnormally developed. The condition leads to inadequate blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanosis, poor feeding, growth retardation, and a history of respiratory infections. The presence of a heart murmur and clubbing are also consistent with this condition. However, the specific details of the heart's abnormal anatomy would need to be clarified to confirm this diagnosis.

+4 Pulmonary Atresia:
This rare congenital malformation involves the complete closure of the pulmonary valve, which prevents blood from flowing from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery and reaching the lungs. The patient's symptoms of cyanosis, poor feeding, and growth failure could be associated with this condition. The presence of a heart murmur and a single loud second heart sound could also be seen in pulmonary atresia. However, the exact nature of the heart murmur and the abnormal positioning of the heart's two main arteries would need further investigation to confirm this diagnosis.

+5 Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS):
HLHS is a severe congenital heart defect in which the left side of the heart is underdeveloped. It affects the normal blood flow through the heart. The patient's symptoms of cyanosis, poor growth, and frequent respiratory infections could be indicative of HLHS. The presence of a heart murmur and abnormal heart imaging are also consistent with this condition. However, the specific finding of abnormal positioning of the heart's two main arteries is not typical for HLHS, as this condition primarily involves the left side of the heart.

+6 Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR):
This is a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Instead, they connect to the right side of the heart or to veins that drain into the right atrium. The patient's symptoms of cyanosis, poor feeding, and respiratory infections could be seen in TAPVR. The presence of a heart murmur and abnormal growth parameters are also consistent with this condition. However, the specific imaging finding of the abnormal positioning of the heart's two main arteries would need to be further evaluated to see if it aligns with the typical presentation of TAPVR.

Please note that these are potential diagnoses based on the provided symptoms. Further diagnostic tests, including echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and genetic testing, would be necessary to confirm the exact condition and to plan appropriate management and treatment."
Malformación anorrectal no sindrómica,"+1 Hirschsprung's Disease:
Hirschsprung's disease is a rare condition that affects the large intestine (colon) and causes problems with passing stool. It is present when a baby is born (congenital) and results from missing nerve cells in the muscles of part or all of the large intestine. In the patient's case, the symptoms of persistent constipation and abdominal distension are common in Hirschsprung's disease. The unusual location of the anal opening and lack of proper muscle control around the anus could be related to the developmental issues associated with this condition. However, Hirschsprung's disease typically does not involve the absence of a passageway for stool to leave the body, which suggests another condition may be present.

+2 Anorectal Malformation (ARM):
Anorectal malformations are a group of rare birth defects in which the anus and rectum (the lower part of the digestive system) do not develop properly. These can range from a slightly abnormal position of the anal opening to the complete absence of an anus. The patient's symptoms, including the unusual location of the anal opening and the noted absence of a passageway for stool to leave the body, are consistent with an anorectal malformation. The lack of proper muscle control around the anus is also a symptom that can be associated with ARM. The absence of other associated anomalies and no family history aligns with some cases of ARM.

+3 Imperforate Anus:
Imperforate anus is a congenital defect where the opening to the anus is missing or blocked. The symptoms of an unusual location of the anal opening and the absence of a passageway for stool to leave the body are characteristic of imperforate anus. This condition can occur with or without fistulas and can be part of a spectrum of anorectal malformations. The persistent constipation and abdominal distension could be a result of this condition. The lack of other associated anomalies and no family history of similar conditions does not rule out imperforate anus.

+4 Intestinal Atresia:
Intestinal atresia is a congenital condition where a part of the intestine is absent or closed. It can lead to bowel obstruction, which may present as constipation and abdominal distension in infants. However, the absence of a passageway for stool to leave the body is more indicative of an anorectal malformation than intestinal atresia. Intestinal atresia typically does not involve abnormalities in the location of the anal opening or muscle control around the anus.

Given the symptoms presented, the most likely diagnosis from the list above would be an anorectal malformation, such as imperforate anus or another form of ARM. Further diagnostic tests, such as imaging studies and possibly a biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to plan the appropriate treatment, which may include surgical intervention."
Linfoma cutáneo primario de células T,"+1 Erdheim-Chester Disease:
Erdheim-Chester Disease is a rare form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by the abnormal multiplication of histiocytes, which can infiltrate multiple organs. Symptoms that the patient has in common with this disease include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and possibly the skin lesions. However, Erdheim-Chester Disease often presents with bone pain and cardiovascular, pulmonary, or central nervous system involvement, which the patient does not report.

+2 Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL):
CTCL is a group of lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by the presence of malignant T-cells in the skin. Common symptoms include skin lesions, which may appear as patches, plaques, or tumors, and can ulcerate as described in the patient's case. The patient's symptoms of persistent fatigue, night sweats, and occasional fevers are also consistent with CTCL. However, significant lymphadenopathy is often present in CTCL, which the patient does not exhibit.

+3 Kaposi Sarcoma:
Kaposi Sarcoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood and lymph vessels. The lesions are typically red or purple and can appear on the skin or mucous membranes. The patient's multiple, non-healing skin lesions could be consistent with this disease, and systemic symptoms such as weight loss and night sweats may occur. However, Kaposi Sarcoma is commonly associated with immunosuppression, particularly in individuals with HIV/AIDS, which is not indicated in this patient's history.

+4 Granuloma Annulare:
Granuloma Annulare is a chronic skin condition characterized by raised, reddish or skin-colored bumps that form ring patterns, typically on the hands and feet. While the patient does have raised, red patches and nodules, Granuloma Annulare usually does not cause systemic symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, fevers, or night sweats, which the patient is experiencing.

+5 Lymphomatoid Papulosis:
Lymphomatoid Papulosis is a rare skin disorder that presents with recurrent, self-healing papules and nodules. The skin manifestations could be similar to those described in the patient's case. Systemic symptoms are less common but can include malaise and fever. The absence of significant lymphadenopathy in the patient is not typical for Lymphomatoid Papulosis, which often involves lymph node enlargement.

+6 Paraneoplastic Pemphigus:
This is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that is often associated with underlying neoplasms, particularly lymphoproliferative tumors. The patient's skin lesions could be consistent with this condition, and systemic symptoms such as weight loss and night sweats may be present due to the associated malignancy. However, Paraneoplastic Pemphigus typically also presents with painful mucosal involvement, which is not reported by the patient.

+7 Sweet's Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis):
Sweet's Syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and tender, red lesions on the skin. The patient's fever, fatigue, and skin lesions could suggest this condition. However, Sweet's Syndrome is often accompanied by leukocytosis and a history of an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, which the patient does not report.

Given the patient's symptoms, further diagnostic workup including skin biopsy, blood tests, imaging studies, and potentially a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan."
Hepatitis autoinmune,"+1 Autoimmune Hepatitis:
Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease in which the body's immune system attacks liver cells, leading to inflammation and liver damage. Symptoms the patient has in common with this disease include persistent fatigue, jaundice, abdominal discomfort, abnormal liver function, elevated liver enzymes, and positive anti-liver/kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies. The history of autoimmune disorders within the family and the enlarged liver upon physical examination also align with this condition. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been specified, as the presented symptoms fit well with autoimmune hepatitis.

+2 Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC):
Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic disease that slowly destroys the bile ducts in the liver. Symptoms the patient has in common with PBC include persistent fatigue, jaundice, and abnormal liver function. However, PBC is typically associated with antimitochondrial antibodies rather than anti-liver/kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies, which the patient has. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort and an enlarged liver could be seen in PBC, but the lack of mention of itching (pruritus), a common symptom of PBC, may suggest a less likely fit.

+3 Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC):
Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare, chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts inside and outside the liver. Symptoms the patient has in common with PSC include persistent fatigue, jaundice, abdominal discomfort, and abnormal liver function. The enlarged liver upon physical examination could also be consistent with PSC. However, PSC is more commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and the presence of anti-liver/kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies is not a typical finding for PSC.

+4 Wilson's Disease:
Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. Symptoms the patient has in common with Wilson's disease include persistent fatigue, jaundice, abdominal discomfort, and abnormal liver function. The enlarged liver upon physical examination could also be seen in Wilson's disease. However, Wilson's disease is typically diagnosed in younger patients and is associated with low serum ceruloplasmin levels and Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes, which have not been mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+5 Hemochromatosis:
Hemochromatosis is a condition where the body absorbs too much iron from the diet, leading to iron overload. Symptoms the patient has in common with hemochromatosis include persistent fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and abnormal liver function. The enlarged liver upon physical examination and the history of autoimmune disorders could also be relevant, as there is a hereditary form of hemochromatosis. However, the primary indicator of hemochromatosis is elevated iron levels in the blood, which has not been mentioned in the patient's blood test results.

Given the patient's symptoms and test results, autoimmune hepatitis appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further testing, including a liver biopsy and additional serological tests, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Riñón displásico multiquístico,"+1 Polycystic Kidney Disease (Infantile Type):
This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys. It can lead to kidney dysfunction and hypertension. Symptoms in common with the patient include recurrent urinary tract infections, abdominal distension, a palpable mass in the abdomen, and hypertension. The presence of numerous non-communicating cysts replacing the normal renal parenchyma on ultrasound imaging also aligns with this condition. However, the patient does not have a family history of similar conditions, which is often seen in polycystic kidney disease.

+2 Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK):
MCDK is a developmental disorder of the renal parenchyma where the kidney consists of non-communicating cysts and has no function. Symptoms in common with the patient include a palpable mass in the abdomen and the presence of multiple cysts in one kidney, as seen on ultrasound. The patient's right kidney appears normal, which is consistent with MCDK, as it typically affects only one kidney. However, MCDK is usually not associated with hypertension.

+3 Renal Cystic Disease:
This encompasses a group of disorders characterized by the presence of multiple cysts in the kidneys. Symptoms in common with the patient include the presence of multiple cysts in one kidney and a palpable abdominal mass. The patient's history of hypertension and recurrent urinary tract infections could be related to complications from the cysts. However, the lack of family history and the fact that the disease is typically bilateral (affecting both kidneys) do not completely align with this patient's presentation.

+4 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC):
TSC is a genetic disorder that can cause non-cancerous tumors to form in many different organs, including the kidneys, where they can manifest as angiomyolipomas or cysts. Symptoms in common with the patient include the presence of cysts in the kidney and a history of hypertension. However, the patient does not exhibit other common signs of TSC, such as skin abnormalities, seizures, or developmental delays.

+5 Von Hippel-Lindau Disease:
This is an inherited condition associated with tumors and cysts in multiple organs, including the kidneys. Symptoms in common with the patient include cysts in the kidneys and hypertension. However, the patient does not have a family history of the disease, and other symptoms such as hemangioblastomas in the brain or retina are not reported.

+6 Meckel-Gruber Syndrome:
This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by cystic kidneys, liver fibrosis, and central nervous system malformations. Symptoms in common with the patient include cystic kidneys and a palpable abdominal mass. However, the patient's growth and development milestones are normal, which is not typical for Meckel-Gruber Syndrome, as it usually presents with severe neurological impairment.

Given the patient's symptoms and the findings on the ultrasound, further diagnostic tests, including genetic testing, may be warranted to confirm the diagnosis. It is also important to consult with a pediatric nephrologist and potentially a geneticist to determine the most appropriate management plan for the patient."
Riñón displásico multiquístico unilateral,"+1 Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD):
Polycystic Kidney Disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. These cysts can lead to kidney enlargement and disrupt their normal function. Symptoms the patient has in common with PKD include abdominal discomfort, visible abdominal swelling, and the presence of a palpable mass in the abdominal region, as well as multiple cystic structures in one of the kidneys. The slightly elevated blood pressure could also be associated with PKD. However, the patient does not have a family history of kidney disease, which is common in PKD, and PKD is usually a bilateral condition, affecting both kidneys.

+2 Wilms' Tumor:
Wilms' tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children. Symptoms include abdominal swelling, a palpable mass in the abdomen, and occasionally pain. The presence of a mass and abdominal discomfort align with this condition. However, Wilms' tumor typically presents as a solitary mass rather than multiple cystic structures, and the patient's urinalysis results are normal, which might not be the case with Wilms' tumor.

+3 Hydronephrosis:
Hydronephrosis is not a disease but a condition that occurs when a kidney swells due to the failure of normal drainage of urine from the kidney to the bladder. The symptoms that match include abdominal discomfort, visible abdominal swelling, and a palpable mass which could be the swollen kidney. However, hydronephrosis is usually caused by an obstruction or blockage in the urinary tract, which does not seem to be indicated in this patient's presentation.

+4 Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK):
MCDK is a condition that occurs when one kidney doesn't develop properly in the womb and is made up of cysts and non-functioning kidney tissue. Symptoms in common with this patient include the presence of multiple cysts in one kidney and abdominal swelling. However, MCDK is usually detected in utero or shortly after birth, and the condition often involves the complete non-functioning of the affected kidney, which may not align with the normal urinalysis results.

+5 Cystic Fibrosis:
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It can lead to the development of cysts in various organs, including the kidneys. The patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort and swelling could be related to cystic fibrosis. However, cystic fibrosis typically presents with respiratory symptoms and other systemic signs, which are not mentioned in this patient's case.

+6 Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC):
TSC is a genetic disorder that can lead to the growth of benign tumors in multiple organs, including the kidneys, where they can cause cysts and angiomyolipomas. The patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort, visible swelling, and multiple cystic structures in the kidney could be consistent with TSC. However, TSC usually presents with a range of other symptoms, including skin abnormalities and neurological symptoms, which are not reported in this patient.

Given the symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be Polycystic Kidney Disease, despite the lack of family history. However, further genetic testing and a thorough examination of the patient's family history would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis. It is also important to consider other potential diagnoses not listed here and to consult with a pediatric nephrologist for a more comprehensive evaluation."

Es importante tener en cuenta que estos diagnósticos son hipotéticos y se basan en la información limitada proporcionada. Un diagnóstico preciso requeriría una evaluación clínica completa, pruebas de laboratorio y, posiblemente, estudios genéticos."
Pouchitis,"+1 Pouchitis:
Pouchitis is an inflammation of the ileal pouch, which is created during an IPAA procedure for patients with ulcerative colitis or other forms of inflammatory bowel disease. Symptoms that the patient has in common with this disease include frequent episodes of abdominal discomfort, increased bowel urgency, and watery diarrhea. Fever and a sense of malaise are also common symptoms of pouchitis. This condition is more likely to occur in the described study population, as they have all undergone IPAA.

+2 Crohn's Disease of the Pouch:
Although Crohn's disease typically affects the small intestine and the beginning of the colon, it can also occur in the ileal pouch after an IPAA. Symptoms in common with this disease include abdominal discomfort, increased bowel urgency, and watery diarrhea. Fever and malaise could also be present if there is active inflammation. However, Crohn's disease of the pouch would be a new diagnosis since IPAA is usually performed for ulcerative colitis, not Crohn's disease.

+3 Cuffitis:
Cuffitis is an inflammation of the rectal cuff, which is the remaining part of the rectum that is left after an IPAA procedure. Symptoms that the patient has in common with this disease include abdominal discomfort and increased bowel urgency. Watery diarrhea can also occur, but it is less specific. Fever and malaise might be present if there is significant inflammation.

+4 Irritable Pouch Syndrome:
This is a functional disorder of the ileal pouch that is not due to inflammation. Symptoms that the patient has in common with this disease include abdominal discomfort, increased bowel urgency, and watery diarrhea. However, fever and malaise are not typical symptoms of irritable pouch syndrome, as it is not associated with an inflammatory process.

+5 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Pouchitis:
CMV can cause a secondary infection in the ileal pouch, leading to an inflammatory condition. Symptoms in common with this disease include abdominal discomfort, increased bowel urgency, watery diarrhea, fever, and malaise. This would be considered especially if the patient is immunocompromised or if standard treatments for pouchitis are not effective.

+6 Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO):
SIBO can occur when there is an abnormal increase in the number of bacteria in the small intestine, which can happen after surgical procedures like IPAA. Symptoms in common with this disease include abdominal discomfort, increased bowel urgency, and watery diarrhea. Fever and malaise are not typical symptoms of SIBO.

Each of these potential diagnoses would require further investigation, including but not limited to endoscopic evaluation, biopsy, stool studies, and possibly imaging or serologic testing to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment."
Hipotiroidismo congénito por anomalía del desarrollo,"+1 Congenital Hypothyroidism:
This is a condition present at birth where the thyroid gland is underactive and does not produce enough thyroid hormones. Symptoms in common with the patient include persistent jaundice, poor feeding habits, constipation, delayed developmental milestones, especially in motor skills, dry and cold skin, a distended abdomen, a hoarse cry, slow heart rate, lethargy, a large protruding tongue, a puffy face, and consistently low levels of T3 and T4 hormones. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been specified, as the patient's presentation aligns well with congenital hypothyroidism.

+2 Prader-Willi Syndrome:
This genetic disorder is characterized by a constant sense of hunger, which can lead to excessive eating and life-threatening obesity. Symptoms in common with the patient include poor feeding habits in infancy, unexplained weight gain despite poor appetite, and developmental delays. However, the patient does not exhibit an excessive sense of hunger, which is a hallmark of the syndrome, and there is no mention of the specific genetic abnormalities associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome.

+3 Cushing's Syndrome:
This endocrine disorder is caused by high levels of cortisol in the blood. Symptoms in common with the patient include weight gain and a puffy face. However, the patient does not exhibit other common symptoms of Cushing's Syndrome, such as high blood pressure, purple stretch marks, and increased hair growth. Additionally, Cushing's Syndrome is extremely rare in infants.

+4 Hypopituitarism:
This condition occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce one or more of its hormones or not enough of them. Symptoms in common with the patient include poor growth, delayed developmental milestones, and a puffy face. However, the patient's specific low levels of T3 and T4 hormones suggest a thyroid-specific issue rather than a generalized pituitary problem.

+5 Down Syndrome:
This genetic disorder is caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. Symptoms in common with the patient include delayed developmental milestones and poor muscle tone. However, the patient does not exhibit other common features of Down Syndrome, such as specific facial features (e.g., slanted eyes, flat nasal bridge), and there is no mention of a diagnosis made through genetic testing.

Given the symptoms and medical history provided, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Congenital Hypothyroidism (+1). This condition would explain the majority of the symptoms described, including the low levels of thyroid hormones, which are critical for growth and development. It is important to confirm the diagnosis with further testing and to begin appropriate treatment as soon as possible to improve the patient's prognosis."

However, further genetic testing and comprehensive evaluation would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other similar conditions."
Hernia diafragmática congénita,"+1 Diaphragmatic Hernia:
This condition occurs when there is a defect in the diaphragm, allowing abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity, which can lead to respiratory distress, as the lungs are unable to expand properly. Symptoms in common with the patient: respiratory distress, cyanosis, decreased breath sounds on one side, shift of heart sounds, and X-ray showing abdominal organs in the chest cavity. Symptoms not in common: The provided information does not include any symptoms that are not in common with a diaphragmatic hernia.

+2 Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM):
CPAM is a developmental malformation of the lung, where cystic masses of abnormal lung tissue can cause respiratory distress in newborns. Symptoms in common with the patient: respiratory distress, difficulty in breath control. Symptoms not in common: The presence of abdominal organs in the chest cavity and the shift of heart sounds are not typical features of CPAM.

+3 Congenital Lobar Emphysema:
This is a rare lung condition in newborns where overinflation of one or more lobes of the lung compresses adjacent lobes and can shift mediastinal structures. Symptoms in common with the patient: respiratory distress, cyanosis, decreased breath sounds, and shift of heart sounds. Symptoms not in common: The presence of abdominal organs in the chest cavity is not associated with congenital lobar emphysema.

+4 Tension Pneumothorax:
A life-threatening condition where air accumulates in the pleural space and cannot escape, leading to a collapsed lung and shifting of mediastinal structures. Symptoms in common with the patient: respiratory distress, cyanosis, decreased breath sounds, and shift of heart sounds. Symptoms not in common: The presence of abdominal organs in the chest cavity is not typical of tension pneumothorax.

+5 Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR):
A congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium, causing oxygen-rich blood to enter the wrong chamber. Symptoms in common with the patient: respiratory distress, cyanosis, and difficulty in breath control. Symptoms not in common: The presence of abdominal organs in the chest cavity and the shift of heart sounds to the right are not typical features of TAPVR.

Given the symptoms and the X-ray findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is a diaphragmatic hernia, specifically a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), which is consistent with the presentation of abdominal organs in the chest cavity and the associated respiratory distress. Immediate surgical intervention is typically required to correct the defect and allow for proper lung development and function."
Colangitis biliar primaria,"+1 Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC):
PBC is a chronic disease that slowly destroys the bile ducts in the liver. Symptoms the patient has in common with PBC include persistent fatigue, pruritus (especially at night), dark urine, pale stools, unexplained weight loss, hepatomegaly, mild jaundice, elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and high cholesterol levels. The patient does not have a personal history of autoimmune diseases, but the family history of autoimmune conditions could be relevant, as PBC is considered to have an autoimmune component.

+2 Hemochromatosis:
Hemochromatosis is a condition where the body absorbs too much iron from the diet, leading to iron overload. Symptoms the patient has in common with hemochromatosis include fatigue, dark urine, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes. However, the patient does not exhibit other common symptoms of hemochromatosis, such as joint pain, diabetes, or heart problems. Additionally, pruritus and pale stools are not typical symptoms of hemochromatosis.

+3 Wilson's Disease:
Wilson's Disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper accumulation in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. Symptoms the patient has in common with Wilson's Disease include fatigue, dark urine, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes. However, the patient's age is not typical for Wilson's Disease presentation, which usually occurs in younger individuals. Also, the patient does not exhibit neurological symptoms or Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes, which are characteristic of Wilson's Disease.

+4 Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC):
PSC is a chronic liver disease characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts. Symptoms the patient has in common with PSC include pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, unexplained weight loss, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. However, PSC is more common in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, which the patient does not report.

+5 Cholestasis of Pregnancy:
Cholestasis of pregnancy occurs when the normal flow of bile is affected by the hormonal changes of pregnancy. Symptoms the patient has in common with this condition include pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, and elevated liver enzymes. However, this condition is not applicable as the patient is not pregnant.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, such as antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) and liver biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Deleción parcial del cromosoma Y,"+1 Klinefelter Syndrome:
Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that affects males who are born with an extra X chromosome (47,XXY instead of the typical 46,XY). Symptoms can include delayed puberty, reduced facial and body hair, and development of breast tissue. Infertility is common due to low testosterone levels and impaired sperm production. Individuals may also have a taller than average height, which does not align with the patient's lower than average height. However, the other symptoms such as reduced facial hair growth, lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, signs of infertility, and a higher voice pitch are consistent with Klinefelter syndrome. The genetic abnormality within the male-specific region of the Y chromosome could be indicative of this condition.

+2 XX Male Syndrome:
XX male syndrome, also known as de la Chapelle syndrome, occurs when an individual has an XX chromosomal makeup but develops male characteristics due to the translocation of SRY gene from the Y chromosome to one of the X chromosomes. Symptoms can include delayed puberty, reduced facial and body hair, and infertility. However, individuals with XX male syndrome typically do not have a lower than average height, which the patient exhibits. The genetic testing revealing an abnormality within the male-specific region of the Y chromosome could suggest this condition, but the height discrepancy would need further investigation.

+3 Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS):
AIS is a condition where a person who is genetically male (with one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to androgens, the male sex hormones. This can result in a male with a nearly female appearance or a male with underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics. Symptoms can include infertility and reduced facial and body hair. However, AIS does not typically present with a lower than average height or a higher voice pitch in males. The genetic abnormality on the Y chromosome could be related to AIS, but the patient's specific symptoms do not fully align with this diagnosis.

+4 Noonan Syndrome:
Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that can affect both males and females and is characterized by distinctive facial features, short stature, congenital heart defects, and developmental delays. While infertility is not a common symptom of Noonan syndrome, some affected individuals may experience delayed puberty. The patient's lower than average height could be consistent with Noonan syndrome, but the lack of other common features such as heart defects and specific facial features makes this diagnosis less likely.

+5 Leydig Cell Hypoplasia:
Leydig cell hypoplasia is a rare condition caused by mutations in the luteinizing hormone receptor gene, leading to underdeveloped Leydig cells in the testes, which are responsible for testosterone production. Symptoms can include ambiguous genitalia or undervirilization in males, leading to delayed puberty, reduced facial and body hair, and infertility. The patient's symptoms of delayed puberty, reduced facial hair growth, and infertility align with this condition. However, the genetic abnormality within the male-specific region of the Y chromosome would need to be further explored to confirm this diagnosis, as Leydig cell hypoplasia is typically associated with mutations in a different gene.

Please note that these are hypothetical diagnoses based on the provided symptoms, and actual diagnosis would require a thorough clinical evaluation, including detailed medical history, physical examination, and additional genetic and hormonal testing."
Artritis idiopática juvenil,"+1 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA):
JIA is a group of arthritic conditions that affect children. It is characterized by joint swelling, pain, and stiffness, which are symptoms present in the patient group. The duration of symptoms exceeding six weeks is also consistent with JIA. Additional symptoms such as fever and rash can be associated with certain subtypes of JIA. The slight female dominance aligns with the higher prevalence of JIA in females. However, eye inflammation is not mentioned as a common symptom in all JIA cases, and the diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds of the patients do not specifically correlate with JIA.

+2 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):
SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the joints. It can cause persistent joint swelling, pain, and stiffness, which matches the symptoms of the patient group. Fever and rash are also common in SLE, fitting the additional symptoms observed. Eye inflammation can occur but is not a defining feature. SLE is more common in females, which is consistent with the group's gender distribution. However, SLE typically presents with a wider range of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems, which may not have been observed in this patient group.

+3 Rheumatic Fever:
Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can develop after a streptococcal infection. It can cause joint swelling, pain, and stiffness, similar to the symptoms in the patient group. Fever and rash are also symptoms of rheumatic fever, aligning with the additional symptoms seen. However, rheumatic fever is less common in developed countries and is usually associated with a recent history of strep throat or scarlet fever, which is not indicated in the patient group's history.

+4 Lyme Disease:
Lyme disease is an infectious disease caused by the Borrelia bacterium, which is transmitted by ticks. It can cause joint swelling, pain, and stiffness, especially in the knees, which is consistent with the patient group's symptoms. Some patients may also experience fever and rash, particularly a characteristic ""bull's-eye"" rash. Eye inflammation is not a typical feature. The disease is more prevalent in certain geographic areas where the ticks are endemic, and there is no mention of exposure to tick-infested areas in the patient group's history.

+5 Sarcoidosis:
Sarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the joints, skin, and eyes. It can cause joint pain and swelling, which matches the patient group's symptoms. Eye inflammation is also a common feature of sarcoidosis, fitting with the additional symptoms in some individuals. Skin rashes can occur, but the type of rash may differ from those observed in the patient group. Sarcoidosis typically affects adults, and the age range of the patient group is between 1 and 16 years, which is less common for sarcoidosis.

+6 Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF):
FMF is a genetic disorder that causes recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation in the abdomen, chest, and joints. It can lead to joint swelling, pain, and stiffness, which are present in the patient group. Fever is a hallmark of FMF, aligning with the additional symptoms. However, FMF is more common in people of Mediterranean descent, and the patient group has a diverse ethnic background. Additionally, FMF episodes are typically acute and recurrent, not persistent as described.

In conclusion, based on the symptoms and demographic information provided, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) seems to be the most likely diagnosis for the patient group. However, further diagnostic tests, including laboratory tests and imaging, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential rare diseases."
Artritis idiopática juvenil oligoarticular,"+1 Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA):
JIA is a type of arthritis that affects children. It is characterized by inflammation of the joints, which can lead to swelling, pain, and stiffness, often worse in the morning or after a period of inactivity. The patient's symptoms of persistent discomfort, swelling in the knee, morning stiffness, and limited range of motion are consistent with JIA. Elevated inflammatory markers in her blood work also support this diagnosis. However, the absence of systemic symptoms such as fever and rash, as well as a lack of family history, are not typical for JIA, although not all patients with JIA have a family history of the disease or systemic symptoms.

+2 Osteochondritis Dissecans:
This condition involves the separation of a piece of bone from its surrounding region due to a lack of blood supply. The symptoms can include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, which may be similar to what the patient is experiencing. However, Osteochondritis Dissecans usually affects older children and teenagers, and it is often associated with activity-related pain, which does not seem to be the case here as the patient's pain is persistent and not solely related to activity.

+3 Lyme Disease:
Lyme disease is an infectious disease caused by the Borrelia bacterium, which is transmitted by ticks. Symptoms can include joint swelling and pain, which are present in this patient. However, Lyme disease often presents with systemic symptoms such as fever, rash (especially a bull's-eye rash), and fatigue, which the patient does not have. Additionally, a history of tick exposure would be expected, which is not mentioned.

+4 Leukemia:
Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. Joint pain and swelling can be symptoms of leukemia, and elevated inflammatory markers may be seen. However, leukemia typically presents with systemic symptoms like fever, fatigue, and weight loss, which the patient does not have. Additionally, other blood work abnormalities are usually present in leukemia, which are not indicated here.

+5 Growing Pains:
Growing pains are a benign condition that typically affects children. They can cause pain and discomfort in the limbs and joints, particularly at night. However, growing pains do not cause joint swelling, warmth, or limited range of motion, and they are not associated with elevated inflammatory markers, making this an unlikely diagnosis for the patient.

Given the information provided, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) seems to be the most likely diagnosis, but further investigation, including imaging studies and possibly a referral to a pediatric rheumatologist, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Hipospadias posteriores,"+1 Hypospadias:
This condition is characterized by the opening of the urethra being located somewhere other than the tip of the penis, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. It can also be associated with a curvature of the penis, known as chordee, which the patient also exhibits. Difficulties during urination, such as a sprayed or dribbled urine stream, are common symptoms of hypospadias. The patient does not exhibit any symptoms that are not in common with hypospadias.

+2 Epispadias:
Epispadias is a rare congenital defect in which the urethra opens on the upper aspect of the penis. This condition can also lead to an abnormal curvature and difficulties with urination. However, the patient's urethral opening is towards the base of the penis, not on the upper aspect, which is not consistent with epispadias.

Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, shortness of breath, and heart murmur. Symptoms not in common include the specific structural abnormalities associated with HLHS, which typically involve the left ventricle, mitral valve, aortic valve, and aorta, and are not described in the patient's condition.

Given the patient's symptoms and echocardiographic findings, the most likely diagnosis from this list appears to be Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD), as it closely matches the description of the patient's heart defect. However, a thorough differential diagnosis should be conducted to rule out other conditions and confirm the diagnosis. Further genetic testing and consultation with a pediatric cardiologist would be advisable to understand the etiology of the defect, especially given the absence of a family history of congenital heart diseases."
Canal aurículoventricular completo,"+1 Tetralogy of Fallot:
Tetralogy of Fallot is a rare congenital heart defect characterized by four key features: a ventricular septal defect (a hole between the heart's lower chambers), pulmonary stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonary valve and outflow tract), right ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the muscular walls of the right ventricle), and an overriding aorta (the aorta is positioned over the ventricular septal defect instead of arising exclusively from the left ventricle). Symptoms in common with the patient include rapid breathing, poor weight gain, heart murmur, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), and structural heart abnormalities on echocardiogram. Symptoms not in common: The specific combination of the four defects must be confirmed for a definitive diagnosis.

+2 Transposition of the Great Arteries:
Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) is a congenital heart defect where the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed (transposed). This condition leads to oxygen-poor blood being circulated to the body and oxygen-rich blood being cycled back to the lungs. Symptoms in common with the patient include rapid breathing, poor weight gain, cyanosis, and an enlarged heart on a chest X-ray. Symptoms not in common: The specific structural abnormality where the great arteries are switched must be identified on echocardiogram.

+3 Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return:
Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR) is a rare congenital heart defect in which the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Instead, they connect to the right atrium, causing oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood. Symptoms in common with the patient include rapid breathing, poor weight gain, cyanosis, and signs of heart failure such as an enlarged heart. Symptoms not in common: The specific abnormal pulmonary vein connection must be observed on imaging studies.

+5 Truncus Arteriosus:
Truncus Arteriosus is a rare form of congenital heart disease where a single blood vessel comes out of the right and left ventricles, instead of the normal two vessels (pulmonary artery and aorta). This single vessel carries both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood. Symptoms in common with the patient include rapid breathing, poor weight gain, heart murmur, cyanosis, and an enlarged heart on a chest X-ray. Symptoms not in common: The presence of a single arterial trunk arising from the heart must be confirmed on echocardiogram.

+6 Pulmonary Atresia:
Pulmonary Atresia is a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary valve does not form properly, which affects the blood flow from the heart to the lungs. Symptoms in common with the patient include rapid breathing, poor weight gain, heart murmur, cyanosis, and signs of heart failure such as an enlarged heart. Symptoms not in common: The specific defect of the pulmonary valve or atresia must be confirmed through imaging.

+7 Ebstein's Anomaly:
Ebstein's Anomaly is a rare heart defect affecting the tricuspid valve, which separates the right atrium from the right ventricle. The valve is malformed and positioned lower than normal in the right ventricle, leading to blood leakage back into the atrium. Symptoms in common with the patient include heart murmur and signs of heart failure such as an enlarged heart. Symptoms not in common: The specific malformation of the tricuspid valve and its displacement must be confirmed on echocardiogram.

Given the symptoms and familial history, it is crucial to perform a detailed evaluation, including a thorough echocardiographic study, to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate management and treatment for the infant."
Síndrome de Brugada,"+1 Brugada Syndrome:
Brugada Syndrome is a rare genetic condition that can lead to dangerous irregular heart rhythms. It is more common in males and often manifests in adulthood. Symptoms include fainting spells, irregular heart rhythms, and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The ECG pattern of Brugada Syndrome is characterized by a specific ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V1-V3), which aligns with the symptoms described. Patients typically do not have structural heart disease, which is also consistent with the patient's profile. However, the median age range of 40 to 50 years is slightly higher than the typical age of onset for Brugada Syndrome, which is often in the 30s.

+2 Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT):
CPVT is a rare inherited heart rhythm disorder that can lead to sudden cardiac death, especially in young individuals. Symptoms include stress or exercise-induced irregular heart rhythms and fainting spells. While the patient's symptoms of irregular heart rhythms and fainting align with CPVT, the condition is usually diagnosed in children or young adults, which does not match the median age range of 40 to 50 years. Additionally, CPVT is typically not associated with the specific ECG pattern described in the patient's profile.

+3 Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC):
ARVC is a rare form of cardiomyopathy that affects the muscle of the right ventricle of the heart. It can cause arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Symptoms include palpitations, fainting, and in some cases, sudden cardiac arrest. The condition is often familial. However, ARVC is usually associated with structural changes in the heart, which is not consistent with the patient's lack of underlying structural heart disease. The ECG changes in ARVC also differ from the specific ST-segment elevation described.

+4 Long QT Syndrome (LQTS):
LQTS is a rare heart rhythm disorder that can cause fast, chaotic heartbeats, potentially leading to fainting, seizures, or sudden death. It is often inherited and can be triggered by stress or exercise. While some symptoms such as fainting spells and irregular heart rhythms are common with the patient's profile, LQTS is typically associated with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. Additionally, the specific ST-segment elevation pattern described is not characteristic of LQTS.

+5 Short QT Syndrome (SQTS):
SQTS is a rare inherited cardiac condition characterized by a shortened QT interval on the ECG, which can lead to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Symptoms can include palpitations, fainting, and sudden cardiac arrest. While the patient's symptoms of cardiac arrest and fainting are consistent with SQTS, the condition is defined by a short QT interval, not the ST-segment elevation described in the patient's ECG.

Based on the information provided, Brugada Syndrome (+1) appears to be the most likely diagnosis, given the specific ECG pattern and the absence of structural heart disease, which are hallmark features of this condition. However, further genetic testing and consultation with a cardiologist specializing in electrophysiology would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and discuss appropriate management strategies."
Fibrosis quística,"+1 Cystic Fibrosis:

Symptoms in common with the patient include lower limb paralysis, limited control over bowel and bladder functions, hydrocephalus, learning difficulties, and a history of a birth defect involving the spinal cord. The patient's susceptibility to infections, physical development impairment, and orthopedic issues such as scoliosis are also consistent with meningomyelocele.

Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis from this list appears to be spina bifida, specifically meningomyelocele, as it closely matches the majority of the patient's symptoms and medical history. However, a thorough medical evaluation, including imaging and consultation with specialists, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Atresia biliar,"+1 Alagille Syndrome:
This genetic disorder affects the liver, heart, and other parts of the body. Symptoms that the patient has in common with Alagille Syndrome include persistent jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, and an enlarged liver. The small or absent gallbladder seen on ultrasound is also a characteristic feature of this condition. Symptoms not mentioned that are commonly associated with Alagille Syndrome include distinctive facial features, heart murmurs due to cardiac anomalies, and issues with the skeletal system, eyes, and kidneys.

+2 Biliary Atresia:
This is a condition in infants where the bile ducts outside and inside the liver are scarred and blocked. Symptoms in common with the patient include persistent jaundice, pale stools, dark urine, and an enlarged liver. The elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes are also indicative of this disease. The small or absent gallbladder on ultrasound is consistent with biliary atresia. Symptoms not in common include the progression to cirrhosis and liver failure if not treated early with surgery.

+3 Neonatal Hepatitis:
This inflammation of the liver occurring in early infancy can be caused by various infections or metabolic disorders. The patient's symptoms that match neonatal hepatitis include jaundice, underweight despite adequate feeding, dark urine, pale stools, and an enlarged liver and spleen. Elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes are also seen in this condition. Symptoms not in common might include fever or signs of infection, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+4 Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC):
PFIC is a group of genetic liver disorders that disrupt the body's ability to form bile properly. Symptoms that the patient has in common with PFIC include persistent jaundice, failure to thrive (underweight), pale stools, dark urine, and an enlarged liver. Elevated levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes are also typical of PFIC. The small or absent gallbladder could be related to this condition. Symptoms not in common might include pruritus (itching), which is not mentioned in the patient's case.

+5 Choledochal Cyst:
This is a congenital condition where cysts form in the bile ducts, causing obstruction. The patient's symptoms that align with a choledochal cyst include jaundice, pale stools, and potentially an enlarged liver. The abnormal gallbladder seen on ultrasound could be related to this condition. Symptoms not in common include abdominal pain or a mass that can be felt in the upper right side of the abdomen, which are not described in the patient's symptoms.

+6 Tyrosinemia Type 1:
This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down the amino acid tyrosine. Symptoms in common with the patient include jaundice, failure to thrive, pale stools, dark urine, and an enlarged liver and spleen. Elevated liver enzymes are also a feature of tyrosinemia. Symptoms not in common include a cabbage-like odor and neurological crises, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

Further diagnostic tests, including genetic testing and possibly a liver biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment for the patient."
Fístula anal,"+1 Crohn's Disease:
Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, including the anus and rectum. Symptoms that the patient has in common with Crohn's disease include recurrent discomfort in the rectal area, intermittent periods of throbbing pain, discharge of pus and blood, irritation around the anal region, and occasional fever. The history of anorectal abscess and surgery could also be related to complications of Crohn's disease. However, the patient does not report changes in bowel habits, which are often seen in Crohn's disease, nor does he mention other common symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or weight loss.

+2 Anal Fistula:
An anal fistula is an abnormal connection between the epithelialized surface of the anal canal and the perianal skin. Symptoms that match the patient's presentation include recurrent discomfort in the rectal area, discharge of pus and blood, irritation around the anal region, and a history of anorectal abscess and surgery. The small opening in the skin near the anus with surrounding erythema and tenderness could be indicative of an anal fistula. The patient's lack of nausea or weight loss is not inconsistent with this diagnosis.

+3 Hidradenitis Suppurativa:
Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin condition characterized by recurrent, painful nodules and abscesses, typically in areas where skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, and anal region. The patient's symptoms of recurrent discomfort, intermittent throbbing pain, discharge of pus, and occasional fever could be consistent with this condition. However, hidradenitis suppurativa typically presents with nodules and abscesses in other areas as well, which the patient does not report.

+4 Perianal Abscess:
A perianal abscess is an infection in the tissue surrounding the anus, leading to a collection of pus. The patient's symptoms of recurrent discomfort, throbbing pain, discharge of pus and blood, and irritation around the anal region are consistent with a perianal abscess. The history of prior anorectal abscess and surgery, as well as the examination findings, support this diagnosis. The lack of changes in bowel habits, nausea, or weight loss does not rule out a perianal abscess.

+5 Fournier's Gangrene:
Fournier's gangrene is a rare but serious infection of the genitals and perianal region. It is characterized by necrotizing fasciitis of the external genitalia or perineum. While the patient does present with pain, discharge, and fever, which can be seen in Fournier's gangrene, the lack of rapid progression, extensive necrosis, or systemic toxicity makes this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, Fournier's gangrene is typically more acute and severe than the patient's presentation.

+6 Proctitis:
Proctitis is inflammation of the lining of the rectum. Symptoms that the patient has in common with proctitis include discomfort in the rectal area, occasional discharge of pus and blood, and irritation around the anal region. The history of anorectal abscess could be related to or a result of proctitis. However, proctitis is often associated with other symptoms such as a frequent or continuous feeling of needing to have a bowel movement, which the patient does not report.

+7 Anal Cancer:
Anal cancer can present with symptoms such as rectal bleeding, discharge, pain, and a mass or ulceration near the anus. The patient's symptoms of discomfort, discharge, and a small opening near the anus could be suggestive of anal cancer. However, the lack of a palpable mass or ulceration during examination and the absence of systemic symptoms like weight loss make this diagnosis less likely.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis appears to be an anal fistula or a recurrent perianal abscess. Further diagnostic tests, such as an MRI or an examination under anesthesia, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan."
Infección por adenovirus en pacientes inmunocomprometidos,"+1 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. It's not typically associated with compromised immune systems or viral infections. Symptoms can include hypermobile joints and stretchy, fragile skin.
- Common Symptoms: None
- Uncommon Symptoms: Fever, sore throat, pink eye, pneumonia

+2 Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID):
CVID is a disorder that impairs the immune system. People with CVID are highly susceptible to infections from various kinds of bacteria and viruses. Symptoms can include recurrent infections, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal issues.
- Common Symptoms: Compromised immune system, pneumonia
- Uncommon Symptoms: Fever, sore throat, pink eye

+3 Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome:
This is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), immune deficiency, and recurrent infections. It primarily affects males and can lead to symptoms such as bleeding, and infections.
- Common Symptoms: Compromised immune system
- Uncommon Symptoms: Fever, sore throat, pink eye, pneumonia

+4 Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID):
SCID is a group of rare, life-threatening genetic disorders that result in combined T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte deficiencies. This leads to severe immune system impairment and a high susceptibility to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections.
- Common Symptoms: Compromised immune system
- Uncommon Symptoms: Fever, sore throat, pink eye, pneumonia

+5 Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD):
GvHD is a complication that can occur after an organ transplant or stem cell transplant in which the donated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells view the recipient's body as foreign and attack the body. Symptoms can include skin rash, liver dysfunction, and gastrointestinal problems.
- Common Symptoms: Compromised immune system
- Uncommon Symptoms: Fever, sore throat, pink eye, pneumonia

+6 X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA):
XLA is an inherited immunodeficiency disorder where the body produces very few B cells, leading to a lack of antibodies and increased vulnerability to infections. Symptoms include recurrent bacterial infections, but viral infections are less common.
- Common Symptoms: Compromised immune system
- Uncommon Symptoms: Fever, sore throat, pink eye, pneumonia

+7 Hyper IgM Syndrome:
This is an immunodeficiency disorder characterized by normal or high levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) with a deficiency in other types of immunoglobulins. This leads to an increased susceptibility to infections. Symptoms can include recurrent infections, particularly sinopulmonary infections.
- Common Symptoms: Compromised immune system
- Uncommon Symptoms: Fever, sore throat, pink eye, pneumonia

+8 Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD):
CGD is a disorder that affects the immune system's ability to kill certain bacteria and fungi, leading to recurrent infections. Symptoms can include infections of the lungs, skin, and lymph nodes.
- Common Symptoms: Compromised immune system
- Uncommon Symptoms: Fever, sore throat, pink eye, pneumonia

Given the symptoms and the compromised immune systems due to underlying conditions such as organ transplants, HIV/AIDS, and cancer treatments, it is more likely that the viral infection is a consequence of the weakened immune system rather than a rare disease itself. However, further testing and clinical evaluation would be necessary to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment."
Uveítis posterior no infecciosa,"+1 Behçet's Disease:
Behçet's disease is a rare inflammatory disorder that can affect various parts of the body, including the eyes, mouth, skin, and genitals. It is characterized by recurrent mouth ulcers, genital ulcers, and uveitis, which is inflammation of the eye. The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, floaters, pain, redness, and inflammation in the back of the eye could be consistent with ocular involvement in Behçet's disease. However, the absence of mouth and genital ulcers makes this diagnosis less likely.

+2 Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Disease (VKH):
VKH is a rare autoimmune disease that targets pigmented tissues, which often include the eyes, skin, and meninges. It is characterized by bilateral granulomatous uveitis, which can lead to vision loss, and may also cause hearing loss, vitiligo, and meningeal irritation. The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, floaters, and eye inflammation could be indicative of VKH. However, the lack of bilateral eye involvement, skin depigmentation, and other systemic symptoms may not fully support this diagnosis.

+3 Sarcoidosis:
Sarcoidosis is a multi-system inflammatory disease that commonly affects the lungs and lymph nodes but can also involve the eyes, skin, and other organs. Ocular sarcoidosis can present with uveitis, similar to the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's history of autoimmune disorders, sarcoidosis could be a consideration. However, the absence of respiratory symptoms or bilateral eye involvement and the lack of systemic signs such as lymphadenopathy or lung involvement may not align with a typical presentation of sarcoidosis.

+4 Uveitis associated with Psoriatic Arthritis:
Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis, which the patient has a history of. Uveitis can be a complication of psoriatic arthritis. The patient's symptoms of eye pain, redness, blurred vision, and inflammation in the back of the eye could be consistent with uveitis secondary to psoriatic arthritis. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's medical history, although the absence of joint symptoms at the time of presentation is noted.

+5 Autoimmune Retinopathy:
Autoimmune retinopathy is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause progressive vision loss due to the immune system attacking retinal cells. Symptoms can include blurred vision, floaters, and visual field loss. The patient's symptoms of blurred vision and floaters, along with a history of autoimmune disorders, could suggest autoimmune retinopathy. However, the presence of significant inflammation in the back of the eye is not a typical feature of this condition.

+6 Sympathetic Ophthalmia:
Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare bilateral diffuse granulomatous uveitis that occurs after trauma or surgery to one eye, which then affects both eyes. While the patient's symptoms of blurred vision, floaters, and eye inflammation are consistent with uveitis, there is no history of trauma or surgery to the eye, making this diagnosis less likely.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a possible autoimmune or inflammatory etiology for the eye symptoms, with uveitis associated with psoriatic arthritis being a plausible diagnosis given the patient's known autoimmune conditions. Further investigation, including laboratory tests, imaging, and possibly a referral to an ophthalmologist or rheumatologist, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential rare diseases."
Pénfigo vulgar,"+1 Pemphigus Vulgaris:
Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes painful blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes, most commonly in the mouth. The patient's symptoms of persistent, painful oral sores and skin blistering align with this condition. Dysphagia can also occur if the sores are present in the esophagus. Skin peeling at the slightest touch is consistent with the fragility of the skin seen in pemphigus vulgaris. The lack of response to antibiotics and topical creams is also indicative, as pemphigus vulgaris typically requires systemic immunosuppressive treatment. However, the severe infections reported are not a direct symptom of pemphigus vulgaris, although they can occur due to the compromised skin barrier.

+2 Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita:
Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that causes the skin to be very fragile, leading to blistering and erosion with minor trauma. The symptoms of skin peeling at the slightest touch and blistering are characteristic of EBA. The presence of painful oral sores and dysphagia can also be associated with this condition. The severe infections could be a result of the extensive skin damage and poor healing. The ineffectiveness of antibiotics and topical creams is consistent with EBA, as treatment typically involves systemic immunosuppression.

+3 Behçet's Disease:
Behçet's disease is a rare inflammatory disorder of unknown cause, which can lead to multiple system involvement. It is more common in individuals of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent. The symptoms of persistent, painful oral sores and skin blistering could be manifestations of Behçet's disease. Dysphagia is less common but can occur if there are esophageal ulcers. However, the symptom of skin peeling at the slightest touch is not typical of Behçet's disease, and severe infections are not a hallmark of the condition.

+4 Cicatricial Pemphigoid:
Cicatricial pemphigoid is a rare chronic autoimmune blistering disease that primarily affects mucous membranes, including the mouth, and can lead to scarring. The persistent, painful oral sores and dysphagia could be due to mucosal involvement. Skin blistering can occur but is less common. The lack of response to antibiotics and topical creams is consistent with the autoimmune nature of the disease. However, the symptom of skin peeling at the slightest touch is not typical for cicatricial pemphigoid, and severe infections are not a direct symptom of the disease.

+5 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN):
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and its more severe form, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, are rare, serious disorders of the skin and mucous membranes, often due to a reaction to medication or an infection. The symptoms of skin blistering and peeling at the slightest touch are characteristic of SJS/TEN. Painful oral sores are also common. However, dysphagia is not a typical symptom, and the severe infections could be secondary to the extensive skin damage rather than a direct symptom of SJS/TEN. The lack of response to antibiotics and topical creams is consistent with the condition being a reaction rather than an infection.

Given the symptoms presented, further diagnostic tests such as skin biopsies, direct immunofluorescence, and blood tests for autoantibodies would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis. It is also important to review the patients' medication histories and consider potential drug reactions. A multidisciplinary approach involving dermatologists, immunologists, and possibly gastroenterologists would be beneficial in managing these complex cases."
Síndrome del corazón izquierdo hipoplásico,"+1 Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS):
This is a rare congenital heart defect where the left side of the heart is critically underdeveloped. It affects normal blood flow through the heart. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanosis, rapid breathing, difficulty feeding, lethargy, and decreased urine output. The echocardiogram findings of an underdeveloped left side of the heart and an enlarged right side, along with a heart murmur, are also consistent with HLHS. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been mentioned, as the provided symptoms align well with this condition.

+2 Critical Coarctation of the Aorta:
This condition involves a severe narrowing of the aorta, which can impede normal blood flow and increase pressure before the constriction while reducing it after the point of narrowing. Symptoms in common with the patient include heart murmur, difficulty feeding, and signs of heart failure such as lethargy and decreased urine output. However, the echocardiogram findings described do not specifically mention coarctation of the aorta, which is a key diagnostic feature of this disease.

+3 Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR):
TAPVR is a rare congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Instead, they connect to the right side of the heart, causing oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanosis, rapid breathing, and signs of heart failure. However, the echocardiogram findings do not specifically mention the abnormal connection of the pulmonary veins, which is a hallmark of TAPVR.

+4 Tricuspid Atresia:
This is a form of congenital heart disease where the tricuspid valve is absent or abnormally developed, preventing blood from flowing from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanosis, difficulty feeding, lethargy, and a heart murmur. The echocardiogram might show an enlarged right side of the heart due to increased work to pump blood, but the specific finding of tricuspid atresia would need to be confirmed, as it is not explicitly mentioned in the patient's echocardiogram results.

+5 Tetralogy of Fallot:
This condition is characterized by four heart defects that result in insufficiently oxygenated blood being pumped to the body: ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. Symptoms in common with the patient include cyanosis and a heart murmur. However, the echocardiogram findings described do not match the typical presentation of Tetralogy of Fallot, which usually includes a combination of the four defects mentioned.

Given the symptoms and echocardiogram findings, Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) seems to be the most likely diagnosis for this patient. However, further diagnostic tests and consultations with a pediatric cardiologist would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment."
Enfermedad de Charcot-Marie-Tooth tipo 1,"+1 Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT):
CMT is a group of inherited disorders that affect the peripheral nerves. It is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, particularly in the lower extremities, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. Foot deformities such as high arches and hammer toes are also common in CMT. The patient's occasional tingling and numbness in the hands and feet, as well as the family history of similar symptoms, support this potential diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of major illnesses or injuries and normal vital signs do not rule out CMT, as it primarily affects the peripheral nerves and muscles.

+2 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA):
SMA is a genetic disorder that leads to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy due to the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. While the patient's symptoms of muscle weakness and atrophy are consistent with SMA, this condition typically presents earlier in life and may not be as consistent with the patient's adult-onset symptoms and family history. Additionally, the presence of sensory deficits and foot deformities are not typical features of SMA.

+3 Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP):
HNPP is an inherited nerve disorder that causes transient episodes of numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness. The patient's symptoms of tingling and numbness could be related to HNPP, but the progressive nature of his muscle weakness and atrophy, as well as the foot deformities, are not typical of HNPP, which usually presents with episodic rather than progressive symptoms.

+4 Friedreich's Ataxia (FA):
FA is an autosomal recessive inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. It is characterized by muscle weakness, loss of coordination (ataxia), and sensory deficits. The patient's progressive muscle weakness and sensory loss could suggest FA, but the disease typically includes ataxia, which the patient does not report. Additionally, FA often presents with symptoms such as speech problems and heart disease, which the patient does not have.

+5 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):
ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. While the patient's muscle weakness and atrophy could be indicative of ALS, this condition does not usually present with sensory deficits or inherited patterns as seen in the patient's family history. Furthermore, ALS typically progresses more rapidly than what the patient describes.

+6 Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy (HMSN):
HMSN, also known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, encompasses a group of disorders that affect the peripheral nerves. The patient's symptoms of muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory deficits, foot deformities, and family history are all consistent with HMSN. This is a broad category that includes several types of CMT, and further genetic testing would be necessary to determine the specific subtype.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, including nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and genetic testing, would be required to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific type of CMT or other hereditary neuropathies."
Miocardiopatía dilatada familiar aislada,"+1 Fabry Disease:
Fabry disease is a genetic disorder that results from the buildup of a particular type of fat, called globotriaosylceramide, in the body's cells. Common symptoms include pain in the hands and feet, small, dark red spots on the skin, cloudiness of the eye, and issues with the gastrointestinal system. Heart-related symptoms can include irregular heartbeats, an enlarged heart, and heart failure. 
- Symptoms in common: Irregular heartbeats, enlarged heart chamber.
- Symptoms not in common: Pain in hands and feet, dark red spots on the skin, cloudiness of the eye.

+2 Cardiac Amyloidosis:
Cardiac amyloidosis, also known as ""stiff heart syndrome,"" occurs when amyloid proteins are deposited in the heart tissue, leading to an abnormal thickening and affecting the heart's ability to pump blood. Symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet. It can also cause irregular heartbeats and an enlarged heart on imaging tests.
- Symptoms in common: Persistent fatigue, shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, irregular heartbeats, enlarged heart chamber.
- Symptoms not in common: Specific symptoms such as numbness or carpal tunnel syndrome, which are sometimes associated with amyloidosis, are not mentioned.

+3 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy:
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. It's often hereditary and can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, irregular heartbeats, and swelling in the legs and ankles. An echocardiogram can show the thickened heart muscle.
- Symptoms in common: Shortness of breath, irregular heartbeats, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, family history of heart disease.
- Symptoms not in common: The patient's echocardiogram shows an enlarged heart chamber, which is not typical for HCM, as it usually shows thickened walls rather than chamber enlargement.

+4 Dilated Cardiomyopathy:
Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by the dilation and weakening of the heart's main pumping chamber, the left ventricle. It can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the lower extremities. It can also cause irregular heartbeats and is often diagnosed through an echocardiogram showing an enlarged heart chamber.
- Symptoms in common: Persistent fatigue, shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, irregular heartbeats, enlarged heart chamber.
- Symptoms not in common: There may be additional symptoms such as chest pain or fainting that are not mentioned.

+5 Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD):
ARVD is a rare type of cardiomyopathy that involves the replacement of right ventricle muscle with fat and/or fibrous tissue. This leads to heart rhythm problems and can cause symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs. An EKG can show abnormalities, and an echocardiogram may reveal changes in the right ventricle.
- Symptoms in common: Shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, irregular heartbeats.
- Symptoms not in common: The patient's echocardiogram shows an enlarged heart chamber, but ARVD typically affects the right ventricle specifically, which is not mentioned.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, it is important to consider these potential rare diseases, among others, and to conduct further testing to confirm a diagnosis. Genetic testing, cardiac MRI, and possibly a heart biopsy may be necessary to differentiate between these conditions and to establish an accurate diagnosis."
Gastrosquisis,"+1 Gastroschisis:
Gastroschisis is a birth defect where the baby's intestines extend outside of the body through a hole next to the belly button. The condition is similar to what is described for the patient, with an abdominal wall defect and protruding small intestine loops. However, in gastroschisis, the liver is typically not involved and remains inside the abdomen, which aligns with the patient's presentation. Symptoms in common with the patient include the abdominal wall defect on the right side of the umbilical cord and the protruding small intestine loops. Symptoms not in common are not mentioned, as the description fits well with gastroschisis.

+2 Omphalocele:
Omphalocele is another abdominal wall defect at birth, but in this condition, the intestines and other organs such as the liver are covered by a thin layer of tissue and protrude from the belly button. In this patient's case, the liver is in a normal position, which is not typical for omphalocele, as the liver is often involved in the protrusion. Symptoms in common with the patient include the abdominal wall defect and the protruding small intestine loops. Symptoms not in common include the liver's position and the lack of a protective sac around the protruding organs.

+3 Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH):
CDH is a condition where there is a hole in the diaphragm that allows abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity, affecting lung development. This patient does not exhibit symptoms of respiratory distress or mention of organs in the chest cavity, which are common in CDH. Symptoms in common with the patient: none specifically mentioned. Symptoms not in common include the lack of respiratory issues and the liver's normal position, as the liver can sometimes be found in the chest cavity in CDH cases.

+4 Intestinal Atresia:
Intestinal atresia is a congenital condition where a part of the intestine is narrowed or absent, leading to blockages and potential distension. While this patient does have abdominal distension, there is no mention of intestinal blockage or missing intestinal segments. Symptoms in common with the patient include abdominal distension and feeding difficulties. Symptoms not in common include the specific nature of the intestinal defect, as atresia does not typically present with intestines protruding outside of the abdominal cavity.

+5 Malrotation with Midgut Volvulus:
This condition involves an abnormal rotation of the midgut during fetal development, which can lead to twisting (volvulus) and obstruction. The patient's symptoms do not specifically indicate malrotation or volvulus, but abdominal distension could be a sign of related complications. Symptoms in common with the patient include abdominal distension and feeding difficulties. Symptoms not in common include the lack of evidence of twisted intestine or obstruction, and the external protrusion of intestines is not a typical feature of this condition.

Given the patient's symptoms, Gastroschisis seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic imaging and surgical consultation would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment."
Linfedema primario,"+1 Lymphedema praecox (Meige's disease):
Lymphedema praecox is a condition characterized by the onset of lymphedema typically during puberty or early adulthood, leading to swelling, often in the lower limbs. It can be hereditary, which aligns with the family history mentioned. The patient's symptoms of unilateral lower limb swelling, a feeling of heaviness, and pitting edema without a history of trauma, surgery, or infection are consistent with this condition. However, lymphedema praecox usually presents around puberty, which does not align with the patient's age.

+2 May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS):
May-Thurner Syndrome is a rare condition where the right iliac artery compresses the left iliac vein, leading to swelling, usually in the left leg. It can cause symptoms like those described by the patient, including swelling and a feeling of heaviness. The absence of trauma, surgery, infection, and recent travel or prolonged immobility are also consistent with MTS. However, the hereditary aspect mentioned in the family history is not typical for MTS.

+3 Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS):
KTS is a congenital vascular disorder that often involves limb enlargement, varicose veins, and port-wine stains. The patient's symptoms of limb swelling and discomfort could be related to this syndrome. The hereditary pattern mentioned could suggest a genetic component, which is sometimes seen in KTS. However, the patient does not report other common features of KTS, such as port-wine stains or varicose veins.

+4 Lipedema:
Lipedema is a chronic condition characterized by the symmetrical buildup of painful fat and swelling in the legs and arms. It predominantly affects women and can be mistaken for regular obesity or lymphedema. The patient's symptoms of limb swelling and discomfort, as well as being moderately overweight, could suggest lipedema. The hereditary pattern and absence of systemic symptoms are also consistent with lipedema. However, lipedema typically presents with bilateral and symmetrical swelling, not unilateral.

+5 Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):
DVT is a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the legs. It can cause swelling, pain, and a feeling of heaviness, similar to the patient's symptoms. The lack of recent travel or prolonged immobility makes DVT less likely, but it cannot be ruled out without further investigation. The hereditary aspect could suggest a genetic predisposition to clotting disorders. However, DVT is not typically considered a rare disease.

+6 Primary Lymphedema:
Primary lymphedema is a rare, inherited condition caused by problems with the development of lymph vessels in the body. It leads to swelling due to fluid accumulation, often in the lower limbs. The patient's symptoms, along with the family history of similar symptoms, are consistent with primary lymphedema. The absence of trauma, surgery, or infection and the presence of pitting edema support this diagnosis. However, the age of onset varies and can be earlier or later in life.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, further diagnostic tests such as lymphoscintigraphy, venography, or duplex ultrasonography would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions. Genetic testing might also be considered, given the family history of similar symptoms."
Trisomía,"+1 Down Syndrome:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Developmental delays in speech and motor skills, small head (microcephaly), upward slanting eyes, protruding tongue, single palmar crease, low muscle tone (hypotonia), congenital heart defects, and growth parameters below standard percentiles.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Typically, Down syndrome is associated with a characteristic facial appearance that may include a flat facial profile and a short neck, which is not specified in the patient's presentation. Additionally, Down syndrome can be associated with a family history of the condition due to translocation or mosaicism, but the patient's family history reveals no known genetic disorders.

+2 Williams Syndrome:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Developmental delays, especially in speech, and cardiovascular problems such as heart defects.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Williams syndrome is often characterized by a unique cognitive profile with relative strengths in verbal short-term memory and language, as well as a distinctive facial appearance with full cheeks, a wide mouth, and a small upturned nose, which are not specified in the patient's presentation. Additionally, individuals with Williams syndrome tend to have a very sociable personality, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

+3 Turner Syndrome:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Developmental delays and growth parameters below standard percentiles.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Turner syndrome occurs in females and is characterized by the absence of all or part of a second sex chromosome. The patient is male, making this diagnosis unlikely. Furthermore, Turner syndrome is associated with features such as a webbed neck, swelling of the hands and feet, and a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, which are not described in the patient's symptoms.

+4 Prader-Willi Syndrome:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Developmental delays, low muscle tone, and growth hormone deficiency which can lead to growth parameters below standard percentiles.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Prader-Willi syndrome is often associated with an insatiable appetite leading to obesity in early childhood, which is not mentioned in the patient's presentation. Additionally, patients with Prader-Willi syndrome typically have almond-shaped eyes and a narrow forehead, which are not specified in the patient's symptoms.

+5 Fragile X Syndrome:
Common Symptoms with Patient: Developmental delays, especially in speech and motor skills, and a history of heart defects.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Fragile X syndrome is often associated with intellectual disability, anxiety, and hyperactive behavior, which are not specified in the patient's presentation. Physical features can include a long face, large ears, and flat feet, which are not described in the patient's symptoms.

Given the symptoms presented, Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) appears to be the most likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms align closely with the common features of this genetic condition. However, a definitive diagnosis would require genetic testing, such as karyotyping or chromosomal microarray analysis, to confirm the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. It is important to proceed with further evaluation and testing to provide an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management plan for the patient."
Ictiosis recesiva ligada al cromosoma X,"+1 Ichthyosis X-linked:
The patient's symptoms of rough, dry, and scaly skin present at birth align with X-linked ichthyosis, a condition that is often inherited from the mother and affects male offspring. The intolerance to heat and a tendency to overheat are also consistent with this condition due to the skin's impaired ability to sweat. Recurrent skin infections can occur due to the cracked and dry skin providing an entry point for bacteria. Delayed physical development is not a typical symptom of X-linked ichthyosis, but it could be related to other factors or an associated condition. The thin and brittle hair is not a common symptom of X-linked ichthyosis, but variations in presentation can occur.

+2 Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia:
This rare genetic disorder could explain the patient's symptoms of heat intolerance and thin, brittle hair, as it affects the development of the skin, hair, teeth, and sweat glands. However, the rough, dry, and scaly skin present at birth is not a typical feature of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, which more commonly results in thin, sparse hair, and fewer sweat glands leading to overheating. Recurrent skin infections could be related due to the skin's barrier being compromised. Delayed physical development could be associated with this condition, and the family history suggests a possible genetic link, although this condition typically follows an X-linked recessive pattern affecting males with carrier mothers.

+3 Netherton Syndrome:
Netherton syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that could account for the patient's symptoms of rough, scaly skin and a predisposition to skin infections. It is characterized by a specific type of scaly skin called ichthyosiform erythroderma, and individuals with this condition often have brittle hair, known as trichorrhexis invaginata or ""bamboo hair."" However, Netherton syndrome is not typically associated with delayed physical development, and while overheating can be a concern due to skin issues, it is not a hallmark symptom. The family history of similar symptoms could suggest a genetic component, although Netherton syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which would not typically present in multiple male relatives on the mother's side.

+4 Refsum Disease:
Refsum disease is a rare genetic disorder that can lead to the accumulation of phytanic acid in the body, causing a variety of symptoms including rough, dry, and scaly skin. However, this condition usually presents later in life, not at birth, and is associated with additional symptoms such as retinitis pigmentosa, peripheral neuropathy, and hearing loss, which the patient does not exhibit. The intolerance to heat and recurrent skin infections are not characteristic of Refsum disease. Delayed physical development and thin, brittle hair are not commonly reported with Refsum disease, and the pattern of inheritance does not match the family history described.

+5 Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome:
Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome is a genetic disorder that leads to scaly skin (ichthyosis), intellectual disability, and spasticity. The rough, dry, and scaly skin present at birth could be consistent with this syndrome. However, the patient does not exhibit neurological symptoms like spasticity or intellectual disability, which are key features of Sjögren-Larsson Syndrome. Overheating could be a secondary issue due to the skin's inability to sweat properly. Delayed physical development might be related to the overall impact of the syndrome on the body, but without the neurological symptoms, this diagnosis is less likely. The family history of similar skin symptoms could suggest a genetic link, but the inheritance pattern and full spectrum of symptoms would need to be considered.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, X-linked ichthyosis and hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia appear to be the most likely diagnoses to consider. Further genetic testing and consultation with a dermatologist and geneticist would be beneficial in reaching a definitive diagnosis and developing an appropriate management plan for the patient."
Oclusión arterial periférica aguda,"+1 Buerger's Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans):
This rare disease is associated with severe blockages in the arteries and veins of the limbs, leading to pain and tissue damage. It is strongly linked to tobacco use.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Sudden onset of severe pain in the limb, sensation of coldness, paleness, absence of pulse, history of heavy smoking.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Buerger's Disease typically affects younger individuals, usually under the age of 45.

+2 Acute Limb Ischemia:
This condition occurs when there is a sudden lack of blood flow to a limb, which can cause severe pain and potential tissue death if not treated promptly.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Sudden onset of severe pain in the limb, sensation of coldness, paleness, absence of pulse, intermittent claudication.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Acute limb ischemia can occur at any age but is not specific to smokers or those with high cholesterol.

+3 Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD):
PAD is caused by atherosclerotic blockages in the peripheral arteries, leading to reduced blood flow and can result in claudication and limb pain.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Intermittent claudication, history of high cholesterol, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, pain unrelieved by rest.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: PAD typically develops gradually over time rather than presenting suddenly.

+4 Aortic Dissection:
This is a serious condition in which there is a tear in the wall of the aorta, the large blood vessel branching off the heart, which can lead to sudden severe pain and decreased blood flow to limbs.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Sudden onset of severe pain, sensation of coldness, paleness, absence of pulse.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Aortic dissection usually presents with chest or back pain, and the pain in the limb would typically be secondary to the dissection.

+5 Cholesterol Embolism Syndrome:
This syndrome occurs when cholesterol crystals become lodged in small blood vessels, leading to blockage and inflammation.
Common Symptoms with Patient: History of high cholesterol, sudden onset of pain, sensation of coldness, paleness, absence of pulse.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: Cholesterol embolism syndrome often presents with other systemic symptoms such as renal impairment or skin changes, which the patient has not reported.

Given the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis would be Acute Limb Ischemia, possibly secondary to underlying Peripheral Artery Disease, exacerbated by the patient's non-compliance with medication and risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Immediate vascular assessment and intervention are critical to prevent potential limb loss."
Telangiectasia hemorrágica hereditaria,"+1 Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT):
Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is a genetic disorder that affects blood vessels and can lead to abnormal blood vessel formation. This can result in frequent nosebleeds, telangiectases (small red spots caused by dilated blood vessels) on the skin, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) which can cause bleeding in various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and urinary system.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Recurrent episodes of spontaneous nosebleeds
- Small red spots on the skin (telangiectases), particularly on hands and face
- Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Blood in urine
- Family history of similar symptoms
- Signs of small, dilated blood vessels on oral mucosa and tongue

Symptoms Not in Common with Patient:
- The patient's symptoms align well with HHT, and no contradictory symptoms are reported.

+2 Glanzmann Thrombasthenia:
Glanzmann Thrombasthenia is a rare genetic bleeding disorder characterized by the lack of a protein required for blood clotting. This can lead to prolonged bleeding times, frequent nosebleeds, and easy bruising.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Recurrent episodes of spontaneous nosebleeds
- Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Blood in urine

Symptoms Not in Common with Patient:
- The presence of small red spots on the skin and a family history of similar symptoms are not typical for Glanzmann Thrombasthenia.
- No mention of easy bruising or prolonged bleeding times, which are common in Glanzmann Thrombasthenia.

+3 Von Willebrand Disease (VWD):
Von Willebrand Disease is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the von Willebrand factor, a protein that is critical for blood clotting. Symptoms can include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, and excessive bleeding from small cuts or injuries.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Recurrent episodes of spontaneous nosebleeds
- Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Blood in urine

Symptoms Not in Common with Patient:
- The presence of telangiectases is not a typical feature of VWD.
- The patient's symptoms do not include bleeding gums or excessive bleeding from small cuts, which are common in VWD.

+4 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vascular type):
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues. The vascular type can lead to fragile blood vessels and organs, resulting in easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, and a characteristic thin, translucent skin.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Recurrent episodes of spontaneous nosebleeds
- Blood in urine

Symptoms Not in Common with Patient:
- The patient does not report easy bruising or thin, translucent skin, which are common in the vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
- The presence of telangiectases is not a typical feature of this type of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, such as genetic testing and imaging studies to look for AVMs, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Glomerulonefritis membranoproliferativa primaria,"+1 Alport Syndrome:
Alport Syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. Symptoms that match with the patient include hematuria (blood in urine, which may appear as dark urine), proteinuria (high levels of protein in the urine), and progressive kidney dysfunction. The patient's family history of kidney disorders could be relevant, as Alport Syndrome is often inherited. However, the patient does not exhibit hearing loss or eye problems, which are common in Alport Syndrome.

+2 Fabry Disease:
Fabry Disease is a rare genetic disorder resulting from the buildup of a particular type of fat in the body's cells. Common symptoms include pain in the hands and feet, small, dark red spots on the skin, decreased sweating, and problems with the gastrointestinal system. Kidney issues can also occur, such as protein in the urine and decreased kidney function, which the patient has. However, the patient does not present with the characteristic pain in extremities, skin lesions, or sweating abnormalities.

+3 IgA Nephropathy (Berger's Disease):
IgA Nephropathy is a kidney disease that occurs when IgA, an antibody, builds up in the kidneys, causing inflammation. This can lead to blood in the urine (which may appear dark), proteinuria, and kidney dysfunction, all of which the patient has. High blood pressure is also a common symptom. The absence of other immune-related symptoms such as joint pain or rashes does not rule out this condition, as it can present primarily with kidney-related symptoms.

+4 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS):
HUS is a condition characterized by the destruction of blood cells and kidney failure. It often follows an infection by certain strains of E. coli bacteria. Symptoms include fatigue, decreased appetite, and dark urine due to the breakdown of red blood cells. Kidney involvement can lead to protein in the urine and decreased kidney function. However, the patient does not have a recent history of diarrhea or gastrointestinal illness, which is commonly associated with HUS.

+5 Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS):
FSGS is a disease that causes scarring in the kidneys, specifically in the glomeruli, the filtering units of the kidney. Symptoms can include proteinuria, high blood pressure, and kidney dysfunction, which the patient exhibits. The condition can lead to nephrotic syndrome, which might explain the facial swelling due to fluid retention. The absence of other symptoms such as severe edema in other parts of the body does not exclude this diagnosis.

+6 Dense Deposit Disease (DDD):
DDD, also known as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II, is a rare kidney disorder characterized by the accumulation of abnormal deposits in the glomeruli. This leads to proteinuria, hematuria, and decreased kidney function, which align with the patient's symptoms. High blood pressure can also be a feature. The patient's lack of complement system abnormalities or other immune system issues does not necessarily rule out DDD.

+7 C3 Glomerulopathy:
C3 Glomerulopathy is a rare kidney disease characterized by the deposition of complement component 3 (C3) in the glomeruli. Symptoms include dark urine, proteinuria, and decreased kidney function, which are present in the patient. High blood pressure can also occur. The disease can be sporadic or familial, which might be significant given the patient's family history. The absence of other symptoms such as systemic lupus erythematosus does not exclude this condition.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, further investigation is warranted to narrow down the diagnosis. Genetic testing, kidney biopsy, and a thorough review of the family's medical history could provide additional insights. It is important to consult with a nephrologist and possibly a geneticist to determine the exact cause of the patient's symptoms and to develop an appropriate treatment plan."
Enfermedad de Buerger,"+1 Buerger's Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans):
Buerger's Disease is a rare disease that affects the blood vessels of the limbs and can lead to vascular insufficiency. It is strongly associated with tobacco use. Symptoms in common with the patient include severe pain in the limbs, non-healing wounds on fingers and toes, intermittent claudication, and a history of superficial phlebitis. The poorly palpable pulses and discoloration in the feet are also consistent with this condition. Symptoms not in common include the absence of diabetes, which is not a factor in Buerger's Disease, aligning with the patient's lack of this condition.

+2 Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD):
While not rare, PAD is a condition that can cause similar symptoms to those described. It is characterized by narrowed blood vessels reducing blood flow to the limbs. Symptoms in common with the patient include leg pain that worsens with walking, non-healing wounds, and poorly palpable pulses. The intermittent claudication and discoloration of the feet are also typical of PAD. However, PAD is often associated with diabetes and other risk factors like hypertension, which the patient does not have.

+3 CREST Syndrome:
CREST Syndrome is a rare systemic sclerotic condition that can affect the blood vessels. It is part of the spectrum of systemic sclerosis. Symptoms in common with the patient include non-healing wounds on the fingers and toes and vascular insufficiency. However, the patient does not exhibit other key features of CREST, such as calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, or telangiectasia.

+4 Vasculitis:
Vasculitis encompasses a group of rare disorders that involve inflammation of the blood vessels. Symptoms in common with the patient include severe pain in the limbs, non-healing wounds, and a history of superficial phlebitis. The discoloration of the feet and poorly palpable pulses could also be due to vasculitis. However, the patient's symptoms do not include systemic symptoms often associated with vasculitis, such as fever, fatigue, or weight loss.

+5 Leriche Syndrome (Aortoiliac Occlusive Disease):
This rare condition is caused by the blockage of the abdominal aorta and its iliac branches. Symptoms in common with the patient include leg pain, especially upon walking, and intermittent claudication. The poorly palpable pulses in the lower extremities are also consistent with this syndrome. However, the patient's presentation of non-healing wounds on the fingers and toes and the absence of other symptoms such as erectile dysfunction make this diagnosis less likely.

Given the patient's history and symptoms, Buerger's Disease seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, such as angiography and blood tests, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Tuberculosis,"+1 Tuberculosis (TB):
This infectious disease is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. Symptoms in common with the patient include a persistent cough with blood-streaked sputum, night sweats, low-grade fever, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and decreased breath sounds in the lungs. The patient's history of smoking, recent travel to a developing country, and crowded living conditions are risk factors for TB. Symptoms not in common with the patient include the absence of a family history of TB, as this is not typically a hereditary disease, and the lack of mention of other systemic symptoms such as swollen lymph nodes.

+2 Lung Cancer:
Given the patient's history of smoking and symptoms such as a persistent cough with blood, weight loss, and decreased breath sounds in the right upper lobe, lung cancer could be a consideration. Symptoms in common with the patient include the cough, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), weight loss, and fatigue. Symptoms not in common include the lack of specific symptoms such as chest pain, hoarseness, or difficulty swallowing, which can also be associated with lung cancer.

+3 Sarcoidosis:
This is an inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs but most commonly affects the lungs and lymph glands. Symptoms in common with the patient include cough, fatigue, and weight loss. The decreased lung volume and diffusion capacity on pulmonary function tests could also be indicative of sarcoidosis. Symptoms not in common include the lack of enlarged lymph nodes, skin rashes, or eye symptoms that are often associated with sarcoidosis.

+4 Histoplasmosis:
This is a fungal infection caused by inhaling spores of the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. It is more common in certain developing countries and can present with symptoms similar to tuberculosis. Symptoms in common with the patient include cough, blood-streaked sputum, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. Symptoms not in common include the absence of mention of other symptoms such as chest pain or joint pain, which can sometimes occur with histoplasmosis.

+5 Silicosis:
This is a lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust, which can occur in certain work environments. While the patient's history does not mention occupational exposure, the symptoms of a persistent cough, weight loss, and decreased lung function are in common. Symptoms not in common include the lack of a history of exposure to silica dust and the absence of other symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath on exertion.

Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, it is important to conduct further diagnostic tests, such as a chest X-ray, sputum analysis, and possibly a CT scan of the chest, to narrow down the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment."
Queratitis estromal,"+1 Acanthamoeba Keratitis:
This rare disease is caused by infection with Acanthamoeba, a type of amoeba commonly found in water and soil. Contact lens wearers are at increased risk, especially if they do not practice proper lens hygiene or they swim with lenses in. Symptoms include eye pain, eye redness, blurred vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and the sensation of something in the eye. The patient's symptoms of ocular discomfort, persistent redness, increased sensitivity to light, decreased visual acuity, and foreign body sensation align with this condition. The presence of small, white infiltrates in the stroma is also indicative of Acanthamoeba Keratitis. However, the episodes of watery eyes followed by dry eyes are not typical symptoms of this disease.

+2 Sjögren's Syndrome:
Sjögren's Syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the glands that produce tears and saliva, leading to dry eyes and dry mouth. Although it is more common in women, it can occur in men. Symptoms include dry eyes, a sensation of grittiness or burning in the eyes, and difficulty wearing contact lenses. The patient's episodes of dry eyes could suggest Sjögren's Syndrome. However, the presence of corneal infiltrates and the specific pattern of symptoms reported do not align perfectly with this diagnosis, as Sjögren's typically does not cause corneal infiltrates or acute redness and is not associated with a history of ocular surface diseases.

+3 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS):
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is a rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes, often in reaction to a medication or infection. Symptoms can include severe eye discomfort, redness, and difficulty with vision. The skin reaction is typically more prominent with blisters and peeling skin. The patient's ocular symptoms could be consistent with SJS, but the absence of skin symptoms and the specific presentation of corneal infiltrates make this an unlikely diagnosis.

+4 Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid:
This is a rare chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the mucous membranes, including the conjunctiva of the eyes. It can lead to scarring and vision loss. Symptoms include chronic conjunctivitis, dry eyes, and a foreign body sensation. The patient's symptoms of watery eyes followed by dry eyes could fit this condition, but the presence of white infiltrates in the cornea is not typical for Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid, which is more associated with conjunctival scarring and symblepharon formation.

+5 Keratoconus:
Keratoconus is a progressive eye disease in which the normally round cornea thins and begins to bulge into a cone-like shape. This causes visual impairment. Symptoms include blurred vision, increased sensitivity to light, and a sensation of something in the eye. The patient's decreased visual acuity and foreign body sensation could be suggestive of Keratoconus. However, the inflammatory signs and white infiltrates observed are not characteristic of this condition, which is more associated with corneal thinning and protrusion.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be Acanthamoeba Keratitis, especially considering the contact lens use and prior ocular surface diseases. However, further diagnostic tests, such as corneal scraping for culture and microscopy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Microtia,"+1 Goldenhar Syndrome:
Goldenhar Syndrome is a rare congenital condition characterized by the incomplete development of the ear, nose, soft palate, lip, and mandible. It is typically associated with anomalies of the eyes, spine, and heart. In this case, the patient's symptoms of a smaller, irregularly shaped right ear and a narrowed external auditory canal are consistent with Goldenhar Syndrome. However, the absence of other physical abnormalities, such as eye or spine issues, and the lack of developmental delays make this diagnosis less likely.

+2 Microtia:
Microtia is a congenital deformity where the external ear (pinna) is underdeveloped. It can affect one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). The patient's significantly smaller and irregularly shaped right ear, along with a narrowed external auditory canal and diminished hearing capability, align with the characteristics of Microtia. The normal development of the left ear and the absence of other anomalies or developmental delays are also consistent with unilateral Microtia.

+3 Treacher Collins Syndrome:
Treacher Collins Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by deformities of the ears, eyes, cheekbones, and chin. The condition often includes underdeveloped facial bones and a very small jaw and chin (micrognathia). While the patient's ear anomaly could be a symptom of Treacher Collins Syndrome, the lack of other facial abnormalities and normal growth parameters do not support this diagnosis.

+4 Hemifacial Microsomia:
Hemifacial Microsomia is a condition in which the lower half of one side of the face is underdeveloped and may affect the ear, mouth, and jaw. The patient's underdeveloped right ear could be a sign of this condition. However, the typical facial asymmetry and other craniofacial anomalies associated with Hemifacial Microsomia are not present in this patient, making this diagnosis less probable.

+5 Oculo-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum (OAVS):
OAVS, also known as Goldenhar Syndrome, involves a wide range of symptoms including vertebral anomalies, ear anomalies, and eye abnormalities. The patient's ear deformity fits the OAVS profile, but the lack of vertebral and eye abnormalities, as well as the absence of a family history, make this diagnosis less likely.

+6 Branchiootorenal Syndrome:
Branchiootorenal Syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause hearing loss, structural abnormalities in the ears, and kidney problems. The patient's ear deformity and hearing loss are consistent with this syndrome. However, the absence of branchial arch defects, renal anomalies, and a family history of similar conditions suggest that this is not the correct diagnosis.

Given the patient's presentation, Microtia seems to be the most likely diagnosis, as it specifically involves the ear and does not necessarily present with other physical or developmental abnormalities. Further diagnostic testing, including genetic testing and imaging, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Carcinoma raro de páncreas,"+1 Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:
Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the formation of one or more tumors in the pancreas or the upper part of the small intestine (duodenum) that secrete excessive levels of the hormone gastrin. This leads to increased stomach acid, resulting in peptic ulcers and chronic abdominal discomfort. Symptoms in common with the patient: chronic abdominal discomfort. Symptoms not in common with the patient: diarrhea, which is a common symptom of Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, is not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+2 Pancreatic Cancer:
Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the pancreas. It often has a poor prognosis and can present with nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fatigue, and jaundice due to bile duct obstruction. The presence of an abnormal mass in the upper abdomen and elevated enzyme levels could be indicative of pancreatic cancer. Symptoms in common with the patient: unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, persistent fatigue, yellowish tinge to skin and eyes, abnormal mass in the upper abdomen, elevated enzyme levels, and a family history of gastrointestinal cancer. Symptoms not in common with the patient: back pain, new-onset diabetes, and changes in stool color or consistency, which are also associated with pancreatic cancer, have not been reported.

+3 Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC):
Primary Biliary Cholangitis is a chronic disease that slowly destroys the bile ducts in the liver, leading to a buildup of bile that can cause jaundice. It is more common in females and is often associated with other autoimmune conditions. Symptoms in common with the patient: chronic abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and jaundice. Symptoms not in common with the patient: itching, which is a hallmark symptom of PBC, is not mentioned, and the condition is less common in males.

+4 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):
Hepatocellular Carcinoma is a primary liver cancer that is often associated with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Risk factors include smoking and alcohol consumption. It can present with abdominal pain, weight loss, jaundice, and an abdominal mass. Symptoms in common with the patient: history of smoking, occasional alcohol consumption, weight loss, jaundice, and the presence of an abnormal mass in the upper abdomen. Symptoms not in common with the patient: cirrhosis or chronic liver disease has not been specified, and other symptoms like ascites and variceal bleeding are not mentioned.

+5 Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST):
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors are rare tumors of the gastrointestinal tract that can cause abdominal discomfort, a palpable mass, and gastrointestinal bleeding, which may lead to anemia and fatigue. They can also cause weight loss and are sometimes detected incidentally on imaging studies. Symptoms in common with the patient: chronic abdominal discomfort, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and the presence of an abnormal mass in the upper abdomen. Symptoms not in common with the patient: gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia, which are common in GIST, have not been reported.

+6 Cholangiocarcinoma (Bile Duct Cancer):
Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare and aggressive form of cancer that originates in the bile ducts. It can cause jaundice, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. It is more common in individuals with a history of liver disease, but can also occur sporadically. Symptoms in common with the patient: unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, yellowish tinge to skin and eyes, and elevated enzyme levels. Symptoms not in common with the patient: itching and changes in stool or urine color, which are also symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma, have not been mentioned.

Please note that these are potential rare diseases based on the symptoms provided, and further diagnostic tests would be necessary to confirm any diagnosis. It is also important to consider more common conditions that could present with similar symptoms."
Esclerosis sistémica,"+1 Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma):
Systemic sclerosis is a rare chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis (hardening and tightening) of the skin and internal organs. The patient's symptoms of progressive skin tightening, Raynaud's phenomenon, heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and shortness of breath are consistent with this condition. The presence of shiny, tight skin and dilated blood vessels (telangiectasias) on her face and hands also align with systemic sclerosis. However, systemic sclerosis can also involve other organ systems, and further investigation would be needed to assess for additional organ involvement.

+2 Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD):
MCTD is a rare autoimmune disorder that may present with features of systemic sclerosis, lupus, and polymyositis. Symptoms such as Raynaud's phenomenon, skin tightening, and difficulty swallowing could be seen in MCTD. The patient's shortness of breath and fatigue might also be related to this disease. However, MCTD typically includes symptoms from multiple connective tissue diseases, and the patient would need to be evaluated for additional signs such as muscle weakness or arthritis to support this diagnosis.

+3 Dermatomyositis:
Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory muscle disease that often presents with a distinctive skin rash, muscle weakness, and systemic symptoms. While the patient does have skin changes and fatigue, the lack of muscle weakness and the specific rash associated with dermatomyositis (such as a heliotrope rash on the eyelids or Gottron's papules on the knuckles) makes this diagnosis less likely. However, the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon and difficulty swallowing could overlap with dermatomyositis, so it cannot be completely ruled out without further testing.

+4 CREST Syndrome:
CREST syndrome is a limited form of systemic sclerosis characterized by Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly (tightening of the skin on the fingers), and Telangiectasias. The patient's symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon, heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and the presence of telangiectasias and sclerodactyly are consistent with CREST syndrome. However, the systemic skin involvement she is experiencing might suggest a more diffuse form of systemic sclerosis rather than the limited form seen in CREST syndrome.

+5 Polymyositis:
Polymyositis is a rare inflammatory disease that causes muscle weakness and can be associated with other systemic symptoms. The patient's fatigue could be related to this condition, but the primary symptoms of polymyositis are muscle weakness and muscle pain, which the patient has not reported. The skin changes and Raynaud's phenomenon are not typical features of polymyositis, making this diagnosis less likely.

+6 Eosinophilic Fasciitis:
Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare syndrome that causes inflammation and thickening of the fascia, the connective tissue beneath the skin. It can lead to skin tightening, which may resemble systemic sclerosis. However, the patient's symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon and esophageal dysmotility are not typical for eosinophilic fasciitis. Additionally, eosinophilic fasciitis often presents with a ""peau d'orange"" or orange peel texture to the skin, which has not been described in this patient.

In summary, the patient's symptoms most closely align with systemic sclerosis, but further diagnostic tests, including blood work for specific autoantibodies, imaging studies, and possibly a skin biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential rare diseases."
Síndrome del corazón izquierdo hipoplásico,"+1 Coarctation of the Aorta:
This is a congenital condition where a portion of the aorta is narrowed, leading to obstructed blood flow. Symptoms that match include difficulty feeding, excessive sweating, rapid breathing, weaker pulse on one side of the body, and bluish skin coloration. The history of heart failure and abnormal heart imaging tests also align with this condition. Symptoms not in common have not been specified, as the provided information is consistent with coarctation of the aorta.

+2 Tetralogy of Fallot:
This rare congenital heart defect is characterized by four heart defects that change the way blood flows to the lungs and through the heart. The symptoms in common with the patient's presentation include difficulty feeding, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), and heart abnormalities on imaging tests. However, the patient's history does not mention some of the other classic symptoms of Tetralogy of Fallot, such as a heart murmur or ""Tet spells"" (sudden episodes of deep blue skin, nails, and lips after crying or feeding).

+3 Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS):
HLHS is a rare congenital heart defect where the left side of the heart is underdeveloped. The patient's symptoms that match include difficulty feeding, rapid breathing, weaker pulse on the left side, and heart failure. The echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and cardiac MRIs indicating structural heart abnormalities are also consistent with HLHS. Symptoms not in common are not detailed, as the patient's symptoms fit well with this diagnosis.

+4 Eisenmenger Syndrome:
This is a long-term complication of congenital heart defects that cause left-to-right shunts, leading to pulmonary hypertension and cyanosis. The patient's symptoms that match include bluish skin coloration and heart failure. However, Eisenmenger Syndrome typically develops later in life after prolonged shunt exposure, and the patient's age and the absence of a history of a shunt defect make this diagnosis less likely.

+5 Pulmonary Atresia:
A congenital heart defect where the pulmonary valve does not form properly, preventing blood from flowing from the heart to the lungs. The patient's symptoms that match include difficulty feeding, rapid breathing, and heart failure. The bluish skin coloration is also a symptom of this condition due to the lack of oxygenated blood. However, the weaker pulse on one side is not a typical symptom of pulmonary atresia.

+6 Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR):
This is a rare congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Symptoms in common with the patient's presentation include difficulty feeding, rapid breathing, bluish skin coloration, and heart failure. The abnormal heart imaging tests are also consistent with TAPVR. Symptoms not in common have not been specified, as the provided information could fit with this diagnosis.

+7 Truncus Arteriosus:
A rare type of heart disease present at birth in which a single blood vessel comes out of the right and left ventricles, instead of the normal two vessels (pulmonary artery and aorta). The patient's symptoms that match include difficulty feeding, excessive sweating, rapid breathing, bluish skin coloration, and heart failure. The abnormal heart imaging tests also align with this condition. Symptoms not in common are not detailed, as the patient's symptoms could be consistent with truncus arteriosus.

Given the patient's symptoms and test results, it is crucial to continue with a thorough diagnostic process, including genetic testing if necessary, to confirm the exact condition and to begin appropriate treatment."
Carcinoma hepatocelular,"+1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary malignancy of the liver, which is more common in individuals with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis C infection and cirrhosis often related to alcohol consumption. Symptoms in common with the patient include general fatigue, poor appetite, unexplained weight loss, a palpable mass in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, mild jaundice, elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels, and multiple lesions in the liver on imaging studies. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been specified, as the presented symptoms align well with HCC.

+2 Hemochromatosis:
Hemochromatosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron accumulation in the body, leading to organ damage. Symptoms in common with the patient could include general fatigue, liver abnormalities, and elevated liver enzymes. However, the presence of a palpable mass, elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels, and multiple liver lesions are not typical features of hemochromatosis. Additionally, the patient's history of alcohol consumption and hepatitis C infection are more indicative of other liver conditions.

+3 Hepatic Angiosarcoma:
Hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive tumor of the blood vessels in the liver. Symptoms in common with the patient include weight loss, fatigue, and abnormal liver function tests. However, hepatic angiosarcoma typically does not present with elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels, which is more characteristic of hepatocellular carcinoma. The presence of multiple lesions in the liver could be seen in hepatic angiosarcoma, but this condition is much less common than HCC.

+4 Liver Metastases:
Liver metastases are cancerous tumors that have spread to the liver from other parts of the body. Symptoms in common with the patient include general fatigue, poor appetite, weight loss, a palpable mass in the abdomen, abnormal liver function tests, and multiple lesions in the liver. However, the elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels are more indicative of a primary liver cancer rather than metastatic disease. Additionally, the patient's history and presentation suggest a primary liver process.

+5 Budd-Chiari Syndrome:
Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare condition caused by occlusion of the hepatic veins that drain the liver. Symptoms in common with the patient could include a palpable mass in the upper right quadrant (due to an enlarged liver), fatigue, and abnormal liver function tests. However, Budd-Chiari syndrome does not typically present with elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels or multiple lesions in the liver as seen in the patient's imaging studies.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), as indicated by '+1'. However, further diagnostic procedures, such as a liver biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential rare diseases."
Síndrome de Marfan,"+1 Marfan Syndrome:
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, which provides strength, support, and elasticity to the structure of the body. Symptoms the patient has in common with Marfan syndrome include elongation of the limbs and digits, above-average height, lean physique, lens dislocation, abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and aortic enlargement. The patient's narrow, highly arched palate is also consistent with this condition. The family history of similar physical traits and cardiovascular issues supports the possibility of Marfan syndrome, as it is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

+2 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vascular type):
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues and can cause a range of symptoms, including hypermobility, skin that stretches easily, and fragile tissues. The vascular type of EDS could explain the cardiovascular issues, as it is associated with an increased risk of arterial and organ rupture. However, the patient does not exhibit the typical skin symptoms or joint hypermobility often associated with EDS, making this diagnosis less likely.

+3 Homocystinuria:
Homocystinuria is a rare inherited disorder that affects the metabolism of the amino acid methionine, leading to an accumulation of homocysteine in the blood and urine. Symptoms in common with this patient include lens dislocation, tall stature, and skeletal abnormalities. However, patients with homocystinuria often have additional features such as intellectual disability and a tendency to form blood clots, which are not mentioned in this patient's presentation.

+4 Loeys-Dietz Syndrome:
Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of aneurysms in the aorta and other arteries, as well as skeletal features similar to those of Marfan syndrome. The patient's aortic enlargement and family history of cardiovascular issues could be indicative of this syndrome. However, patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome often have other distinctive features such as widely spaced eyes, a cleft palate or bifid uvula, and translucent skin, which are not reported in this patient.

+5 Stickler Syndrome:
Stickler syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause serious vision, hearing, and joint problems, as well as a distinctive facial appearance. The patient's history of visual difficulties and abnormal spinal curvature could be related to Stickler syndrome. However, the syndrome is also commonly associated with hearing loss and early-onset arthritis, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, Marfan syndrome (+1) appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further genetic testing and a comprehensive evaluation by a geneticist or a specialist in connective tissue disorders would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other similar conditions."
Mucopolisacaridosis tipo,"+1 Morquio Syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis IV):
Morquio Syndrome is a rare metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down glycosaminoglycans. Symptoms in common with the patient include short stature, skeletal abnormalities, and coarse facial features. Developmental delays and hearing impairment are also consistent with Morquio Syndrome. However, recurrent respiratory infections are not a primary feature of this disease, although they can occur due to skeletal abnormalities affecting the chest and airways.

+2 Hunter Syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis II):
Hunter Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase. Symptoms that match the patient's presentation include coarse facial features, developmental delays, and recurrent respiratory infections. Hearing impairment is also a symptom of Hunter Syndrome. However, the friendly and engaging demeanor is not specifically associated with this condition, and Hunter Syndrome is typically not seen in females as it is an X-linked recessive disorder, which may not align with the sibling's history if the sibling is female.

+3 Hurler Syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis I):
Hurler Syndrome is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder. The patient's symptoms that align with Hurler Syndrome include short stature, skeletal abnormalities, coarse facial features, developmental delays, and hearing impairment. Recurrent respiratory infections are also common in Hurler Syndrome. However, the friendly and engaging demeanor is not a distinguishing feature of this disease.

+4 Sotos Syndrome:
Sotos Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive physical growth during the first years of life. Symptoms that overlap with the patient's condition include developmental delays and motor skill issues. However, the patient's short stature and recurrent respiratory infections are not typical of Sotos Syndrome, which usually presents with overgrowth and advanced bone age.

+5 Williams Syndrome:
Williams Syndrome is a developmental disorder that often results in a friendly and engaging demeanor, which the patient exhibits. However, the primary symptoms of Williams Syndrome include cardiovascular issues, unique facial features, and often a growth spurt in infancy. The patient's short stature, skeletal abnormalities, and coarse facial features are not characteristic of Williams Syndrome.

+6 Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome:
Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome is a condition characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and toes. The patient's short stature and developmental delays are consistent with this syndrome. However, the specific skeletal abnormalities and coarse facial features described do not align perfectly with the typical presentation of Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome.

Given the patient's symptoms and the sibling's similar history, it is important to consider genetic and hereditary factors in the diagnosis. Further genetic testing and consultation with a geneticist may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to provide appropriate management and treatment options for the patient."

Síntomas no presentes: La encefalitis autoinmune suele presentar síntomas más agudos y a menudo está asociada con la presencia de anticuerpos específicos, que no se mencionan en el historial del paciente.

Cada una de estas enfermedades raras requiere una evaluación clínica detallada, pruebas de laboratorio específicas, estudios de imagen y, en algunos casos, pruebas genéticas para confirmar el diagnóstico. Sería prudente referir al paciente a un neurólogo especializado en trastornos del movimiento para una evaluación más profunda y para determinar el curso adecuado de pruebas diagnósticas."
Síndrome de Lennox-Gastaut,"+1 Dravet Syndrome:
Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy that begins in the first year of life with frequent febrile seizures. As the child ages, other types of seizures typically arise, including myoclonic, tonic, and atonic seizures. Developmental delay becomes apparent within the second year of life. The patient's recurring, uncontrolled seizures of varying types, developmental delay, and poor response to antiepileptic drugs are consistent with Dravet syndrome. However, the typical onset age and the absence of a family history of neurological disorders do not align perfectly with this diagnosis.

+2 Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome:
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a type of epilepsy with multiple different types of seizures, particularly tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. It is characterized by a triad of signs including the onset of multiple seizure types, a distinctive EEG pattern showing slow spike-wave complexes, and cognitive impairment. The patient's symptoms of tonic and atonic seizures, cognitive and developmental delays, unique EEG pattern, and poor seizure control despite medication are indicative of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. However, the typical age of onset for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is between 3 and 5 years old, which is slightly older than the patient's seizure onset.

+3 Myoclonic-Astatic Epilepsy (Doose Syndrome):
Myoclonic-Astatic Epilepsy, also known as Doose Syndrome, is characterized by a variety of seizure types including myoclonic, atonic, and tonic-clonic seizures. Seizures often begin in early childhood and can be resistant to treatment. Developmental delays can also occur, particularly affecting speech and motor skills. The patient's atonic seizures, developmental delay, and poor seizure control are consistent with this syndrome. However, the patient does not exhibit myoclonic seizures, which are a hallmark of this condition.

+4 Lafora Disease:
Lafora disease is a progressive myoclonic epilepsy that typically presents in late childhood or adolescence. It is characterized by the presence of myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures, progressive neurological decline, and the presence of Lafora bodies (abnormal glycogen inclusions) in cells. The patient's symptoms do not fully align with Lafora disease, as the age of onset is typically later, and the patient does not exhibit myoclonic seizures or a progressive decline in neurological function.

+5 GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome:
GLUT1 deficiency syndrome is a disorder that impairs brain metabolism. Seizures, developmental delay, and a complex movement disorder can be present. Seizures often start in infancy and can be of various types, including atonic seizures. The patient's developmental delay and atonic seizures could suggest this syndrome, but the patient's normal growth parameters and lack of movement disorder symptoms do not fully support this diagnosis.

+6 Rett Syndrome:
Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological and developmental disorder that affects the way the brain develops, causing a progressive loss of motor skills and speech. This disorder is most commonly seen in girls and can include seizures. The patient's developmental delay and speech issues could be seen in Rett syndrome, but the patient's gender and the specific seizure types do not align with the typical presentation of Rett syndrome.

Given the patient's symptoms, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (+2) seems to be the most likely diagnosis, but further genetic testing and consultation with a neurologist specializing in epilepsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Malformación cavernosa cerebral hereditaria,"+1 Sturge-Weber Syndrome:
Sturge-Weber syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by a congenital facial birthmark and neurological abnormalities. Symptoms in common with the patient include seizures and headaches. However, the patient does not have the hallmark port-wine stain birthmark typically associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome.

+2 Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1):
NF1 is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on nerves. It can lead to a range of symptoms, including learning disabilities, seizures, and muscle weakness. The patient's seizures and muscle weakness are in common with NF1, but she does not exhibit the café-au-lait spots or the benign tumors called neurofibromas that are characteristic of NF1.

+3 Multiple Sclerosis (MS):
MS is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, leading to a wide range of symptoms including balance difficulties, muscle weakness, and memory loss. The patient's balance difficulties, muscle weakness, and memory loss are in common with MS, but MS typically presents with additional symptoms such as vision problems and fatigue, which the patient does not report.

+4 Episodic Ataxia:
Episodic ataxia is a rare genetic disorder that causes sporadic bouts of ataxia, or coordination problems. Symptoms in common with the patient include balance difficulties and muscle weakness. However, episodic ataxia is also often associated with vertigo, which the patient does not report.

+5 CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy):
CADASIL is a genetic condition that leads to damage to the small blood vessels in the brain. It can cause migraines, recurrent strokes, seizures, and cognitive decline. The patient's recurrent headaches, seizures, and memory loss are in common with CADASIL. The family history of similar neurological symptoms could also be indicative of this disease, but the patient does not report any strokes or migraines with aura, which are common in CADASIL.

+6 Mitochondrial Myopathy:
Mitochondrial myopathies are a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to the mitochondria. Common symptoms include muscle weakness and neurological problems. The patient's muscle weakness and seizures are in common with mitochondrial myopathy, but she does not exhibit other typical symptoms such as exercise intolerance or heart problems.

+7 Wilson's Disease:
Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, and other vital organs. It can lead to neurological symptoms such as tremors, poor coordination, and cognitive decline. The patient's coordination impairment and memory loss are in common with Wilson's disease, but she does not report other key symptoms such as liver dysfunction or the characteristic Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes.

+8 Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP):
HSP is a group of inherited disorders that cause progressive weakness and spasticity, primarily in the lower limbs. It can also affect balance and coordination. The patient's sudden weakness in her muscles and coordination impairment are in common with HSP, but the patient does not have the progressive leg spasticity that is typical of HSP.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, further diagnostic tests such as MRI, genetic testing, and possibly a lumbar puncture may be warranted to narrow down the diagnosis and rule out or confirm any of these potential rare diseases."
Queratoconjuntivitis atópica,"+1 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS):
SJS is a rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes. It's usually a reaction to a medication or an infection. Symptoms may include flu-like symptoms followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters, eventually causing the top layer of the skin to die and shed. 
Common symptoms with the patient: Redness in the eyes, burning sensation, sensitivity to light.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: Skin rash, blisters, flu-like symptoms, top layer of skin shedding.

+2 Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid (OCP):
OCP is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the mucous membranes, including the conjunctiva of the eyes. It can lead to chronic conjunctivitis, scarring, and vision loss if not treated.
Common symptoms with the patient: Persistent redness in the eyes, chronic inflammation, tearing, burning sensation, sensitivity to light, thickening of the eyelids.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: Autoimmune blistering and scarring of the conjunctiva, which may not have been observed.

+3 Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis (AKC):
AKC is a chronic allergic inflammation of the eyes that is often associated with atopic dermatitis (eczema). It can lead to complications such as cataracts and keratoconus if untreated.
Common symptoms with the patient: History of eczema, frequent itching, tearing, burning sensation, sensitivity to light, thickening and roughening of the eyelids, pigmentation changes, blurred vision, chronic inflammation.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: The patient's symptoms align well with AKC, and no uncommon symptoms are noted based on the provided information.

+4 Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis (VKC):
VKC is a recurrent, bilateral, and seasonal allergic conjunctival disease, which is more common in young males. It is characterized by a severe itching and foreign body sensation in the eyes.
Common symptoms with the patient: Frequent itching, tearing, burning sensation, sensitivity to light, foreign body sensation in the eye, chronic inflammation.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: VKC is typically seasonal and more common in young males, and the patient is 35 years old. The seasonality of the patient's symptoms is not mentioned.

+5 Sarcoidosis:
Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that affects multiple organs in the body, primarily the lungs and lymph glands. In the eyes, it can cause uveitis and conjunctival granulomas.
Common symptoms with the patient: Persistent redness in the eyes, tearing, burning sensation, sensitivity to light, chronic inflammation.
Uncommon symptoms with the patient: Sarcoidosis typically involves systems other than the eyes, such as the lungs or lymph nodes, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

Based on the symptoms described, Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, including allergy testing, a thorough eye examination by an ophthalmologist, and possibly a biopsy of the conjunctiva, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Riñón displásico multiquístico unilateral,"+1 Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD):
Polycystic Kidney Disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. These cysts can lead to kidney enlargement and disrupt their normal function. Symptoms the patient has in common: recurrent urinary tract infections, abdominal pain, hematuria, and the presence of a palpable abdominal mass. Ultrasonographic findings of multiple kidney cysts also align with PKD. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: Typically, PKD affects both kidneys, and the patient's right kidney appears normal. Additionally, PKD can be associated with high blood pressure, which the patient does not have.

+2 Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK):
Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney is a developmental disorder where the kidney consists of irregular cysts and has non-functioning renal tissue. It usually affects only one kidney. Symptoms the patient has in common: the presence of a palpable abdominal mass, abdominal pain, and the ultrasonographic findings of non-communicating cysts in one kidney. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: MCDK is not typically associated with recurrent urinary tract infections or hematuria, and it is usually diagnosed in the prenatal period or early infancy.

+3 Wilms' Tumor (Nephroblastoma):
Wilms' tumor is a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children. It can present with an abdominal mass, abdominal pain, and occasionally hematuria. Symptoms the patient has in common: a palpable abdominal mass, abdominal pain, and intermittent hematuria. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: Wilms' tumor typically presents as a solid mass rather than multiple cysts, and it may be associated with other growth abnormalities or high blood pressure, which the patient does not exhibit.

+4 Cystic Renal Cell Carcinoma:
Cystic Renal Cell Carcinoma is a form of kidney cancer that can present with multiple cysts, hematuria, and an abdominal mass. Symptoms the patient has in common: the presence of a palpable abdominal mass, hematuria, and cystic changes in the kidney on ultrasonography. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: This type of cancer is very rare in children and is more common in adults. It is also usually associated with other symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+5 Medullary Sponge Kidney (MSK):
Medullary Sponge Kidney is a congenital disorder where cysts develop in the inner part of the kidneys (medulla), leading to recurrent urinary tract infections and sometimes hematuria. Symptoms the patient has in common: recurrent urinary tract infections and hematuria. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: MSK typically does not cause a palpable abdominal mass, and the cysts are usually located in the medulla rather than replacing the normal parenchyma.

Given the patient's symptoms and ultrasonographic findings, Multicystic Dysplastic Kidney (MCDK) seems to be the most likely diagnosis, but further diagnostic tests, such as genetic testing and possibly a biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Dentinogénesis imperfecta tipo 2,"+1 Dentinogenesis Imperfecta:
This is a genetic disorder that affects the development of dentin, the tissue beneath the enamel of the teeth. Symptoms include discolored (grey to brown), translucent teeth, frequent dental fractures, and toothaches due to poorly developed enamel and abnormal pulp chamber morphology. The patient's history of repeated dental fractures, discoloration of teeth, and radiographic findings are consistent with this condition. The familial pattern also supports this diagnosis. However, the patient does not exhibit any bone abnormalities, which can sometimes be associated with certain types of dentinogenesis imperfecta.

+2 Amelogenesis Imperfecta:
Amelogenesis imperfecta is a group of genetic conditions that cause abnormal enamel formation. Symptoms can include discolored teeth, increased tooth decay, and enamel that is thin or absent. The patient's translucent and discolored teeth, thin enamel, and abnormal pulp chamber morphology align with this condition. The lack of bone or other systemic abnormalities and the familial dental history also fit the profile of amelogenesis imperfecta. However, the patient's average stature and intelligence are not directly related to this condition, as it primarily affects the teeth.

+3 Osteogenesis Imperfecta:
Osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as brittle bone disease, is a genetic disorder characterized by fragile bones that break easily, blue sclera, and often dental problems known as dentinogenesis imperfecta. The patient's dental symptoms could suggest a mild form of osteogenesis imperfecta. However, the absence of bone abnormalities and the patient's average stature do not support this diagnosis, as individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta typically present with bone fragility and may have short stature.

+4 Regional Odontodysplasia:
This is a rare developmental disorder affecting the teeth, characterized by ghost teeth with very thin enamel and dentin, leading to discoloration and a higher risk of fractures and decay. The patient's symptoms of translucent teeth, thin enamel, and abnormal pulp chambers could be indicative of regional odontodysplasia. However, this condition usually affects a localized region rather than all teeth, and there is no mention of a localized effect in the patient's description.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, genetic testing would be a prudent next step to confirm the diagnosis, which is likely to be either dentinogenesis imperfecta or amelogenesis imperfecta. These conditions are inherited and would explain the familial pattern of dental issues. The absence of systemic or bone abnormalities helps to narrow down the potential diagnoses."
Dentinogénesis imperfecta,"+1 Dentinogenesis Imperfecta:
Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder that affects tooth development, leading to discolored (yellow to bluish-brown) and translucent teeth. Teeth are often weaker, leading to wear, breakage, and loss of enamel. The condition can also cause bulbous crowns and thin roots with small or absent pulp chambers, as seen in the patient's dental X-rays. It is consistent with the patient's symptoms of discolored, worn-down teeth, and a family history of similar dental issues. However, the patient does not exhibit bone fractures or hearing loss, which can sometimes be associated with certain types of dentinogenesis imperfecta.

+2 Amelogenesis Imperfecta:
Amelogenesis imperfecta is a rare genetic condition affecting the enamel formation, which can result in discolored teeth, ranging from yellow to brownish, and teeth that are prone to damage and wear. The patient's symptoms of discolored teeth and excessive wear align with this condition. However, amelogenesis imperfecta typically does not affect the tooth roots or pulp chambers, which may not fully explain the bulbous crowns and thin roots with small or absent pulp chambers seen in the patient's X-rays.

+3 Regional Odontodysplasia:
Regional odontodysplasia, also known as ""ghost teeth,"" is a rare developmental disorder that affects the formation of the teeth. It can lead to discolored, translucent teeth that are prone to breakage and wear. Dental X-rays may show abnormal tooth structure, such as bulbous crowns and thin roots, which is consistent with the patient's X-rays. However, regional odontodysplasia typically affects a localized region of the mouth rather than all teeth, and the patient's medical history suggests a more generalized condition affecting multiple teeth.

+4 Hypophosphatasia:
Hypophosphatasia is a rare genetic disorder that can lead to abnormal development of the teeth and bones. Symptoms can include premature loss of teeth and poorly mineralized teeth, which may appear discolored and be prone to wear and breakage. Dental X-rays can show thin roots and poor bone density. However, the patient does not exhibit other common symptoms of hypophosphatasia, such as bone fractures or rickets, which are typically present in this condition.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely diagnosis appears to be dentinogenesis imperfecta. However, further genetic testing and consultation with a specialist in genetic disorders may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Ectopia tiroidea,"+1 Achalasia:
Achalasia is a rare disorder of the esophagus, where the muscles fail to relax properly, leading to difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), regurgitation of food, and sometimes chest pain. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and difficulty swallowing solid foods are consistent with achalasia. However, the presence of neck swelling and hoarseness are not typical symptoms of this condition.

+2 Thyroid Cancer:
Thyroid cancer can present with a neck swelling or nodule, hoarseness (due to nerve involvement), difficulty swallowing, and occasionally breathlessness if the tumor is large enough to compress the trachea. The patient's symptoms of neck swelling, hoarseness, and dysphagia align with this diagnosis. However, the lack of family history and the patient's stable vital signs may not fully support this diagnosis without further investigation.

+3 Zenker's Diverticulum:
This is a condition where a pouch forms in the throat, just above the esophagus, leading to difficulty swallowing, regurgitation of undigested food, cough, and sometimes a neck lump that can be felt. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, cough, and neck swelling could suggest Zenker's Diverticulum. The absence of regurgitation of undigested food and the patient's age may not be completely typical, as this condition more commonly affects older males.

+4 Goiter:
A goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland that can cause a visible swelling in the neck. It can also lead to difficulty swallowing and breathlessness if it compresses the trachea. The patient's neck swelling, dysphagia, and breathlessness could be indicative of a goiter. However, the lack of thyroid dysfunction history and the patient's gender (more common in females) may not fully align with this diagnosis.

+5 Myasthenia Gravis:
Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness. It can cause dysphagia, hoarseness, and breathing difficulties due to weakness of the muscles involved in swallowing and respiration. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, occasional hoarseness, and breathlessness could be consistent with Myasthenia Gravis. However, the absence of other common symptoms such as generalized muscle weakness and the fluctuating nature of symptoms would need to be considered.

+6 Laryngeal Cancer:
Laryngeal cancer can present with hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, a cough that doesn't go away, and sometimes breathlessness or a feeling of choking. The patient's hoarseness, persistent cough, and dysphagia could suggest laryngeal cancer. However, the patient's lack of risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use, and the absence of other symptoms like weight loss or persistent sore throat, make this diagnosis less likely without further investigation.

Further diagnostic tests such as imaging studies, endoscopy, and possibly biopsy would be necessary to narrow down the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment for the patient."

+4 Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy (OPCA):
OPCA is a term used to describe a group of disorders that cause degeneration in the part of the brain that controls muscle coordination (cerebellum), leading to ataxia, or problems with movement coordination.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Gait imbalance and frequent falls.
- Difficulty with eye movements.
- Fatigue.

Uncommon Symptoms with Patient:
- The patient's mood and personality changes are not a primary feature of OPCA.
- The patient's swallowing difficulties and slurred speech are not specific to OPCA but can occur.

+5 Lewy Body Dementia (LBD):
LBD is a type of progressive dementia that leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning, and independent function because of abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Changes in personality and mood, such as increased apathy and irritability.
- Difficulty with movement and falls.
- Visual disturbances, which could relate to the double vision.

Uncommon Symptoms with Patient:
- LBD typically presents with more pronounced cognitive decline than the patient is exhibiting.
- The patient's family history does not mention LBD.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, it is important to conduct a thorough neurological examination, possibly including imaging studies like MRI or CT scans, and potentially a referral to a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. Further tests, such as blood tests, sleep studies, or autonomic testing, may be necessary to rule out other conditions and to support a diagnosis."
Hipertensión intracraneal idiopática,"+1 Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH):
Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without a detectable cause. Symptoms often include headaches that are worse in the morning, vision problems such as transient visual obscurations, and pulsatile tinnitus, which is a whooshing sound in the ears. Patients may also experience double vision due to sixth nerve palsy. Overweight individuals, particularly women of childbearing age, are at higher risk. The patient's symptoms of morning headaches, double vision, whooshing sound in the ears, and transient visual obscurations, along with optic disc swelling, are consistent with IIH. The patient does not have symptoms of fever, nausea, or vomiting, which can sometimes be associated with increased intracranial pressure but are not specific to IIH.

+2 Migraine with Brainstem Aura:
Migraine with Brainstem Aura, previously known as basilar-type migraine, is a rare form of migraine that presents with neurological symptoms including double vision, tinnitus, and at times, headache with a throbbing quality. The symptoms can be triggered by various factors and may be accompanied by nausea or sensitivity to light, which the patient does not report. The patient's symptoms of chronic headaches, double vision, and whooshing sound in the ears could be related to this condition, but the lack of other typical migraine features and the presence of optic disc swelling are not typical for migraines.

+3 Benign Intracranial Hypertension:
Benign Intracranial Hypertension is another term for Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) and is characterized by the same symptoms and patient profile as described in +1.

+4 Meniere's Disease:
Meniere's Disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can lead to dizzy spells (vertigo) and hearing loss. In most cases, Meniere's disease affects only one ear. It can cause variable hearing loss, ringing in the ear (tinnitus), and sometimes a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear. While the patient reports a whooshing sound in the ears, the lack of vertigo, hearing loss, and ear fullness or pressure makes this diagnosis less likely.

+5 Chiari Malformation:
Chiari Malformation is a condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. It can cause headaches, often severe and typically at the back of the head, which can be exacerbated by coughing or straining. Some patients may experience visual disturbances or tinnitus. However, the patient's symptoms of optic disc swelling and the specific pattern of headaches and visual symptoms do not align well with Chiari Malformation.

+6 Glaucoma:
Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve, often due to abnormally high pressure in the eye. Chronic headaches and visual disturbances can sometimes be a symptom, particularly if the optic nerve is involved. However, the patient's symptoms of double vision and whooshing sound in the ears are not typical of glaucoma, and the absence of eye pain or loss of peripheral vision makes this diagnosis less likely.

Given the patient's symptoms and findings, Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) seems to be the most likely diagnosis. Further investigations, such as an MRI to rule out secondary causes and a lumbar puncture to measure cerebrospinal fluid pressure, would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment."
Cistinuria,"+1 Cystinuria:
Cystinuria is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of cystine, an amino acid, in the urine, leading to the formation of cystine stones. This condition can cause recurrent kidney stones and chronic urinary tract infections, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. The patient's high levels of cystine in the urine and family history are also consistent with cystinuria. However, the patient's high protein intake is not a direct symptom of cystinuria but could exacerbate stone formation. The genetic testing recommendation is appropriate for confirming this diagnosis.

+2 Primary Hyperoxaluria:
Primary Hyperoxaluria is a rare inherited condition that leads to the overproduction of oxalate, which can form kidney stones and lead to urinary tract infections. While this disease could explain the recurrent kidney stones and urinary tract infections, the patient's laboratory analysis did not indicate elevated oxalate levels, but rather elevated cystine levels, which is not a typical finding in primary hyperoxaluria.

+3 Renal Tubular Acidosis:
Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA) is a group of disorders that involve an accumulation of acid in the body due to a failure of the kidneys to appropriately acidify the urine. While RTA can lead to kidney stones and blood in the urine, the patient's symptoms of elevated amino acids, specifically cystine, do not align with RTA, which typically involves problems with acid-base balance rather than amino acid metabolism.

+4 Dent's Disease:
Dent's Disease is a rare X-linked recessive kidney disorder that often results in kidney stones, hematuria (blood in the urine), and kidney failure. It is associated with high levels of calcium in the urine, not amino acids. The patient's symptoms of kidney stones and blood in the urine could fit, but the elevated amino acid levels, specifically cystine, are not characteristic of Dent's Disease.

+5 Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome:
Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome is a rare inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). It is associated with a variety of symptoms, including kidney problems like stones due to high uric acid levels. However, the patient's symptoms of elevated cystine levels and the absence of other Lesch-Nyhan symptoms, such as self-mutilating behaviors or neurological issues, make this an unlikely diagnosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is Cystinuria. Genetic testing would be the next step to confirm this diagnosis and to guide further management and treatment."
Insuficiencia suprarrenal crónica primaria,"+1 Addison's disease:
Addison's disease is a rare endocrine disorder where the adrenal glands do not produce enough steroid hormones. Symptoms in common with the patient include persistent fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, low blood pressure, lightheadedness upon standing, hyperpigmentation (darkened skin), and salt cravings. Symptoms not in common with the patient include severe abdominal pain, which can be intermittent and is not always present in Addison's disease.

+2 Celiac disease:
Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. Symptoms in common with the patient include abdominal pain, nausea, and weight loss. However, the patient does not report any specific reactions to gluten-containing foods, which is a key feature of celiac disease. Additionally, the skin darkening and salt cravings are not typical symptoms of celiac disease.

+3 Pheochromocytoma:
Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland tissue that can cause the gland to produce excess hormones, leading to high blood pressure. Symptoms in common with the patient include abdominal pain, nausea, and weight loss. However, the patient has low blood pressure, not high, which is not consistent with pheochromocytoma. Also, the patient does not report headaches, sweating, or palpitations, which are common symptoms of this condition.

+4 Whipple's disease:
Whipple's disease is a rare bacterial infection that can affect the gastrointestinal system and other organs. Symptoms in common with the patient include abdominal pain, weight loss, and decreased appetite. However, the patient does not have other symptoms such as joint pain, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms that are often associated with Whipple's disease. Additionally, the patient denies any recent infections.

+5 Sheehan's syndrome:
Sheehan's syndrome is a rare condition caused by severe blood loss during or after childbirth, leading to the destruction of the pituitary gland. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, low blood pressure, and nausea. However, the patient's medical history does not indicate childbirth complications, and the syndrome typically presents shortly after childbirth, not years later.

+6 Hemochromatosis:
Hemochromatosis is a rare genetic disorder where the body absorbs too much iron from the diet. Symptoms in common with the patient include fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain. However, the patient does not have other symptoms such as joint pain, liver abnormalities, or diabetes, which are often associated with hemochromatosis. Additionally, skin darkening in hemochromatosis is typically related to iron deposits, not hyperpigmentation as seen in Addison's disease.

Given the symptoms presented, Addison's disease seems to be the most likely diagnosis, but further testing, including blood tests (ACTH, cortisol levels) and possibly imaging studies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Holoprosencefalia,"+1 Williams Syndrome:
Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, such as a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, and a wide mouth with full lips. Individuals with Williams Syndrome often have developmental delays, learning challenges, and can have heart and blood vessel problems. While the patient has developmental delays and unique craniofacial features, the specific facial characteristics do not fully align with those typical of Williams Syndrome. Additionally, there is no mention of cardiovascular issues, which are common in Williams Syndrome.

+2 Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome:
This is an inherited developmental disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, small head size (microcephaly), intellectual disability, and behavioral problems. It is also associated with multiple congenital anomalies, including issues with feeding and growth. The patient's small head size and developmental delays are consistent with this syndrome, but other common features such as limb abnormalities and genital malformations are not mentioned.

+3 Miller-Dieker Syndrome:
Miller-Dieker Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by lissencephaly (smooth brain), which leads to severe intellectual disability, developmental delays, seizures, and distinctive facial features. The facial features can include a prominent forehead, bitemporal hollowing, a small nose, and a small jaw. The patient's seizures, developmental delays, and brain abnormalities are consistent with this syndrome, but the description of the facial features does not fully match.

+4 Zellweger Spectrum Disorder:
This spectrum of disorders includes Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease. They are characterized by craniofacial dysmorphisms, neurological deficits, seizures, and brain malformations. The patient's seizures and brain abnormalities fit this spectrum, but other symptoms such as hearing loss, vision problems, and liver dysfunction are not mentioned.

+5 Holoprosencephaly:
Holoprosencephaly is a structural anomaly of the brain where the forebrain fails to develop into two hemispheres. It is often associated with craniofacial malformations, including closely set eyes, a flat nose, and cleft lip/palate. The patient's brain abnormalities and craniofacial features are consistent with holoprosencephaly, but the absence of a cleft lip/palate and the specific nature of the craniofacial features would need to be considered.

+6 Mowat-Wilson Syndrome:
This genetic condition is characterized by distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, delayed development, and multiple congenital anomalies. Facial features can include widely spaced eyes, a prominent nasal tip, and a pointed chin. The patient's developmental delays are consistent with this syndrome, but the facial features and other common anomalies such as Hirschsprung disease or congenital heart defects are not mentioned.

Given the patient's symptoms and the lack of family history, genetic testing, including chromosomal microarray analysis and possibly whole exome sequencing, would be a prudent next step to confirm a diagnosis and to rule out or identify any of the above conditions or other genetic syndromes."
Estenosis supravalvular aórtica,"+1 Williams Syndrome:
Williams Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, which often include a broad forehead, full cheeks, and a wide nasal bridge, similar to the patient's description. Individuals with Williams Syndrome may also have heart issues, such as supravalvular aortic stenosis, which could explain the harsh systolic ejection murmur and left ventricular hypertrophy observed in the patient. Mild intellectual disability is another common feature of this syndrome. However, the patient's symptoms of reduced exercise tolerance, rapid fatigue, shortness of breath, and occasional dizziness and fainting are not specific to Williams Syndrome and could be related to the heart condition rather than the syndrome itself. Hypercalcemia is also associated with Williams Syndrome, which aligns with the patient's medical history.

+2 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM):
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. This could lead to symptoms such as reduced exercise tolerance, rapid fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness or fainting, especially during physical activities, as seen in the patient. The electrocardiogram findings of left ventricular hypertrophy are consistent with HCM. The presence of a harsh systolic ejection murmur during the heart examination also supports this diagnosis. HCM can have a genetic component, which may explain the family history of early heart surgery. However, HCM does not typically involve unique facial features or intellectual disability, which are present in this patient.

+3 Noonan Syndrome:
Noonan Syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including unique facial characteristics similar to those described in the patient, such as a broad forehead and wide nasal bridge. Heart defects, particularly pulmonary stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, are common in Noonan Syndrome, which could account for the cardiac findings. Intellectual disability can occur in Noonan Syndrome, which aligns with the patient's mild intellectual disability. However, hypercalcemia is not a typical feature of Noonan Syndrome, and the patient's specific heart murmur would need further investigation to determine if it is associated with the types of heart defects commonly seen in Noonan Syndrome.

+4 LEOPARD Syndrome:
LEOPARD Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that includes multiple features, such as Lentigines (freckling), ECG abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism (wide-spaced eyes), Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormalities of the genitalia, Retardation of growth, and Deafness. The patient's unique facial appearance and cardiac findings could suggest this syndrome. The electrocardiogram evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy is also a possible match. However, the patient does not present with the lentigines or other skin abnormalities typically associated with LEOPARD Syndrome. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of hypercalcemia and the specific type of heart murmur observed would need to be evaluated in the context of other LEOPARD Syndrome features.

+5 Fabry Disease:
Fabry Disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down a specific type of fat, leading to a buildup in various organs. Symptoms can include pain, particularly in the hands and feet, gastrointestinal issues, a characteristic rash, and progressive kidney damage. Cardiac involvement is common and can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy, which the patient exhibits. However, the unique facial features and intellectual disability seen in the patient are not typical of Fabry Disease. Additionally, the patient's exercise intolerance, fatigue, and shortness of breath could be related to cardiac issues but are not specific to Fabry Disease. Hypercalcemia is also not a known symptom of Fabry Disease."
Enfermedad de Hirschsprung,"+1 Hirschsprung's Disease:
Hirschsprung's disease is a rare condition that affects the large intestine (colon) and causes problems with passing stool. It is present when a baby is born (congenital) and results from missing nerve cells in the muscles of part or all of the large intestine. In common with the patient's symptoms are difficulty in passing stool, abdominal swelling, and a lack of appetite. The patient's bouts of diarrhea and constipation are also consistent with Hirschsprung's disease. The fact that the patient is underweight and fatigued could be related to the disease's impact on nutrient absorption and overall health. The family history of digestive issues requiring surgical intervention could suggest a genetic component, which aligns with the disease's hereditary nature. However, the patient does not exhibit other common symptoms such as vomiting or a swollen belly that feels hard to the touch.

+2 Cystic Fibrosis:
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It is characterized by the production of thick, sticky mucus that can clog the intestines and obstruct the pancreas. Symptoms in common with the patient include difficulty in passing stool and a lack of appetite. The patient's underweight status and fatigue could also be explained by cystic fibrosis due to malabsorption of nutrients. However, the patient does not have respiratory symptoms such as persistent coughing, wheezing, or frequent lung infections, which are typical for cystic fibrosis.

+3 Congenital Hypothyroidism:
Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition present at birth where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. This can lead to symptoms such as constipation, poor appetite, and fatigue, which the patient exhibits. The patient's underweight condition could also be a result of the slowed metabolism associated with hypothyroidism. However, the patient does not show other common signs of congenital hypothyroidism, such as jaundice, a large tongue, or a puffy face.

+4 Intestinal Malrotation:
Intestinal malrotation is a congenital anomaly where the intestines do not form in the correct position in the abdomen, which can lead to blockages and complications. The patient's symptoms of difficulty in passing stool, abdominal swelling, and bouts of diarrhea and constipation are consistent with this condition. The lack of appetite and being underweight could also be related to malrotation. However, the patient does not present with other symptoms such as bilious vomiting or rapid heart rate, which are often associated with volvulus (a complication of malrotation).

+5 Organic Acidemia:
Organic acidemias are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by the accumulation of organic acids in the body. Symptoms can include feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, and lethargy, which align with the patient's lack of appetite, being underweight, and fatigue. The bouts of diarrhea could also be a manifestation of the metabolic disturbance. However, the patient does not exhibit other symptoms such as developmental delay or seizures, which are common in organic acidemias.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, genetic testing is a prudent step to confirm a diagnosis. It is important to consider that the patient may have a condition that is not listed here, and a thorough medical evaluation is necessary to reach an accurate diagnosis."
Microtia,"+1 Microtia:
Microtia is a congenital deformity where the external ear (pinna) is underdeveloped. It can affect one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). The condition can range from mild to severe and is often associated with a narrow or absent ear canal, leading to hearing impairment. The patient's symptoms of a smaller, deformed right ear and reduced ear canal size are consistent with microtia. However, the absence of other craniofacial abnormalities and normal developmental progress are also typical of isolated microtia.

+2 Hemifacial Microsomia:
Hemifacial microsomia is a condition where one side of the face is underdeveloped, affecting the ear, mouth, and jaw. It can cause a wide range of abnormalities, including microtia, which the patient exhibits. However, the patient does not have the other common features of hemifacial microsomia, such as facial asymmetry beyond the ear anomaly, or abnormalities of the mouth and jaw.

+3 Goldenhar Syndrome:
Goldenhar Syndrome is a rare congenital condition characterized by incomplete development of the ear, nose, soft palate, lip, and mandible. It is often associated with hemifacial microsomia. Patients may also have vertebral abnormalities and epibulbar dermoids. The patient's presentation of an underdeveloped ear aligns with Goldenhar Syndrome, but the lack of other facial, ocular, or vertebral abnormalities makes this diagnosis less likely.

+4 Treacher Collins Syndrome:
Treacher Collins Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial deformities, typically affecting the cheekbones, jaw, chin, and ears. Patients often have underdeveloped ears, which can lead to hearing loss. However, the syndrome also usually includes downward-slanting eyes, a small lower jaw, and a high palate, none of which the patient presents, making this diagnosis less probable.

+5 Oculo-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum (OAVS):
OAVS, also known as Goldenhar Syndrome, encompasses a range of conditions including hemifacial microsomia. It involves primarily the development of the ears, eyes, and spine. The patient's microtia could be a feature of OAVS, but the absence of eye and vertebral anomalies, as well as normal facial symmetry apart from the ear, suggests that this is not the most fitting diagnosis.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is Microtia, as it specifically pertains to the ear's structure and the hearing issues described, without additional craniofacial abnormalities or systemic involvement. Further evaluation, including genetic testing and hearing assessment, would be beneficial to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment."
Enfermedad de Stargardt,"+1 Retinitis Pigmentosa:
Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Common symptoms include difficulty with night vision and progressive vision loss. 
- Symptoms in common: Gradual progressive vision loss, difficulty with night vision, genetic markers for retinal abnormalities, family history of similar symptoms.
- Symptoms not in common: The patient sample does not specifically mention the presence of the characteristic tunnel vision or the loss of peripheral vision that is typical in RP, as their peripheral vision tends to remain normal for a longer duration.

+2 Stargardt Disease:
Stargardt Disease is a form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration that causes progressive vision loss usually to the point of legal blindness. Symptoms often begin in childhood and include difficulty with color vision and central vision loss, while peripheral vision is often preserved.
- Symptoms in common: Gradually progressive vision loss often beginning in childhood, problems with color vision, central vision decline over time, genetic markers for retinal abnormalities, family history.
- Symptoms not in common: The description does not mention the presence of characteristic flecks that can be seen on the macula in Stargardt Disease.

+3 Cone-Rod Dystrophy:
Cone-rod dystrophy is a group of related eye disorders that cause deterioration of the cone and rod photoreceptor cells, leading to both central and peripheral vision loss. It often presents with problems in color vision and a decrease in central vision.
- Symptoms in common: Gradually progressive vision loss, problems with color vision, decline in central vision, genetic markers for retinal abnormalities, family history.
- Symptoms not in common: The patient sample maintains peripheral vision for a longer duration, which may not align with the typical progression of cone-rod dystrophy where both central and peripheral vision are affected.

+4 Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON):
LHON is a mitochondrial genetic disorder that causes sudden central vision loss, typically in young adults. The disease primarily affects males and is characterized by bilateral, painless subacute loss of central vision.
- Symptoms in common: Family history of similar symptoms, genetic markers for retinal abnormalities, central vision loss.
- Symptoms not in common: The patient sample does not report the sudden onset of symptoms typical of LHON, and the age range of the sample is broader than the typical LHON presentation. LHON also does not usually present with difficulty in night vision.

+5 Usher Syndrome:
Usher Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects both hearing and vision. The vision loss is due to RP, which leads to night blindness and loss of peripheral vision. Hearing loss is present from birth.
- Symptoms in common: Gradual progressive vision loss, difficulty with night vision, genetic markers for retinal abnormalities, family history.
- Symptoms not in common: The patient sample does not report hearing loss, which is a key component of Usher Syndrome.

Given the symptoms described, Stargardt Disease and Retinitis Pigmentosa seem to be the most likely candidates, but further testing, including genetic testing and a thorough clinical examination, would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis."
Displasia broncopulmonar,"+1 Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD):
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disorder that is most common among infants who were born prematurely, with low birth weight and who have received prolonged mechanical ventilation. The condition is characterized by inflammation and scarring in the lungs. 

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Premature birth at 26 weeks of gestation
- Prolonged mechanical ventilation
- Persistent oxygen dependence
- Signs of abnormal lung development with a decreased number of alveoli
- Abnormal vascular growth
- 'Ground-glass' appearance on chest X-rays
- Inability to breathe without assistance
- Poor weight gain
- Frequent respiratory infections

Symptoms Not Common with Patient:
- (None identified; all listed symptoms are consistent with BPD)

+2 Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformation (CPAM):
Congenital pulmonary airway malformation is a developmental malformation of the lung, characterized by cystic masses of abnormal lung tissue that can vary in size. These malformations can compress normal lung tissue and affect breathing.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Signs of abnormal lung development
- Respiratory distress

Symptoms Not Common with Patient:
- Presence of cystic masses (not specified in the patient's symptoms)
- Compression of normal lung tissue by cystic masses (not specified in the patient's symptoms)

+3 Pulmonary Interstitial Glycogenosis (PIG):
Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis is a rare lung disorder affecting infants. It is characterized by the accumulation of glycogen within the lung's interstitial cells. It can present with respiratory distress and ground-glass opacities on imaging.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Respiratory distress post-birth
- 'Ground-glass' appearance on chest X-rays

Symptoms Not Common with Patient:
- Accumulation of glycogen within the lung's interstitial cells (not specified in the patient's symptoms)

+4 Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACD/MPV):
This is a rare congenital malformation involving abnormal development of the capillary vascular system around the alveoli, leading to severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia shortly after birth.

Common Symptoms with Patient:
- Signs of abnormal lung development with a decreased number of alveoli
- Abnormal vascular growth
- Respiratory distress post-birth

Symptoms Not Common with Patient:
- Hypoxemia shortly after birth (the patient's current oxygenation status is not specified)
- Misalignment of pulmonary veins (not specified in the patient's symptoms)

Given the patient's history and symptoms, Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) seems to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, including echocardiography to rule out congenital heart disease and a thorough evaluation by a pediatric pulmonologist, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other potential rare lung diseases."
Empiema pleural,"+1 Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency:
This is a genetic disorder that can cause lung disease and liver disease. The symptoms that the patient has in common with this disease include recurrent respiratory tract infections, persistent cough, and shortness of breath. However, the significant weight loss and night sweats are not typical symptoms of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. The sharp, stabbing chest pain could be related to emphysema, which is a common complication of this condition. The diminished breath sounds could also be consistent with emphysema, but dullness to percussion suggests a possible pleural effusion, which is not a primary feature of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.

+2 Pulmonary Tuberculosis:
This is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient's symptoms that align with tuberculosis include high fever, chills, persistent cough, shortness of breath, significant weight loss, and night sweats. The sharp, stabbing chest pain and dullness to percussion could indicate a pleural effusion, which is often associated with tuberculosis. The high white blood cell count is also consistent with an infection like tuberculosis. The patient's history of chronic smoking and recurrent respiratory infections could have increased his susceptibility to this disease.

+3 Lung Cancer:
Given the patient's history of chronic smoking, lung cancer is a concern. Symptoms that match include persistent cough, shortness of breath, significant weight loss, and night sweats. The sharp, stabbing chest pain could be due to the tumor invading the pleura or chest wall. Diminished breath sounds and dullness to percussion could be due to a pleural effusion secondary to cancer. However, high fever and chills are not typical symptoms of lung cancer, although they could be related to a concurrent infection or paraneoplastic syndromes.

+4 Pleural Effusion:
This is a condition where fluid accumulates in the pleural space around the lungs. The patient's symptoms that are consistent with a pleural effusion include shortness of breath, sharp, stabbing chest pain that worsens with breathing or coughing, and dullness to percussion on one side of the chest. However, pleural effusion itself is a symptom rather than a disease and can be secondary to other conditions such as infections, cancer, or other diseases. The high fever, chills, and high white blood cell count suggest an infectious etiology for the effusion, such as empyema.

+5 Pneumonia:
Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause a range of symptoms. The patient's symptoms that align with pneumonia include high fever, chills, persistent cough, shortness of breath, and a high white blood cell count. The sharp, stabbing chest pain could be due to pleuritic inflammation, and the dullness to percussion could indicate consolidation or pleural effusion associated with pneumonia. However, the significant weight loss and night sweats are more suggestive of a chronic process like tuberculosis or cancer rather than typical acute pneumonia.

Please note that these are hypothetical diagnoses and further investigation, including imaging studies and the results of the sputum culture, would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis."
Tumor estromal gastrointestinal,"+1 Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST):
The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are consistent with a Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST). GISTs are rare tumors that originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract. They are characterized by the proliferation of spindle or epithelioid cells, which can form solid masses. The immunohistochemical markers CD34, CD117 (c-KIT), and DOG1 are commonly positive in these tumors, which is in line with the patient's test results. GISTs can occur anywhere along the digestive tract but are most commonly found in the stomach and small intestine. The patient's lack of prior gastrointestinal diseases does not preclude the diagnosis of GIST.

+2 Carcinoid Tumor:
While the patient's symptoms could suggest a carcinoid tumor, which is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can arise in the digestive tract, the immunohistochemical profile does not match. Carcinoid tumors typically express markers such as chromogranin A and synaptophysin, rather than CD34, CD117, and DOG1. Additionally, carcinoid tumors often present with symptoms related to hormone secretion, which the patient does not have.

+3 Leiomyosarcoma:
Leiomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that originates from smooth muscle cells, which could be found in the gastrointestinal tract. It can present with a mass of spindle cells, similar to the patient's findings. However, leiomyosarcomas typically express smooth muscle markers like desmin and smooth muscle actin (SMA), not the markers CD34, CD117, and DOG1 that were found in the patient's specimen. Therefore, this diagnosis is less likely given the immunohistochemical staining results.

+4 Schwannoma:
Schwannomas are rare tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are responsible for the myelin sheath around peripheral nerves. They can occasionally occur in the gastrointestinal tract. Schwannomas would show S-100 protein positivity on immunohistochemical staining, which is not mentioned in the patient's results. The presence of CD34, CD117, and DOG1 markers, as well as the absence of S-100, makes this diagnosis unlikely.

+5 Desmoid Tumor (Aggressive Fibromatosis):
Desmoid tumors are benign fibrous neoplasms that arise from musculoaponeurotic structures and could theoretically originate in the connective tissue of the digestive tract. They are characterized by the proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. However, desmoid tumors are typically positive for beta-catenin and negative for CD117 and DOG1, which does not match the patient's immunohistochemical staining profile.

Given the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is a Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST), as indicated by the presence of a solid mass of proliferating cells with spindle or epithelioid morphologies, the location within the stomach and small intestine, and the positive immunohistochemical staining for CD34, CD117, and DOG1."
Mucolipidosis tipo III alfa/beta,"+1 Morquio Syndrome:
Morquio Syndrome, also known as Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IV (MPS IV), is a rare metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down glycosaminoglycans. Symptoms in common with the patient include short stature, joint stiffness, limited mobility, frequent respiratory infections, coarse facial features, and corneal clouding. Symptoms not in common with the patient include the fact that Morquio Syndrome typically presents with more severe skeletal abnormalities and may not include cognitive impairment or delayed loss of primary teeth.

+2 Hurler Syndrome:
Hurler Syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I), is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder. Symptoms in common with the patient include slow growth, short stature, joint stiffness, limited mobility, frequent respiratory infections, coarse facial features, delayed loss of primary teeth, hepatomegaly, heart murmurs, dysostosis multiplex, and cognitive impairment. Symptoms not in common with the patient are not clearly stated, but Hurler Syndrome is often associated with more severe developmental delays and may include other systemic manifestations not described in the patient's presentation.

+3 Hunter Syndrome:
Hunter Syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II), is a rare X-linked recessive disorder, typically affecting males, but rare female cases can occur due to skewed X-chromosome inactivation. Symptoms in common with the patient include short stature, joint stiffness, frequent respiratory infections, coarse facial features, hepatomegaly, heart murmurs, and dysostosis multiplex. Symptoms not in common with the patient include the fact that Hunter Syndrome usually presents with more severe progression and additional features such as hearing loss and thickening of the skin, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

+4 Sanfilippo Syndrome:
Sanfilippo Syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III (MPS III), is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the body's inability to properly break down heparan sulfate. Symptoms in common with the patient include mild cognitive impairment and possibly some of the skeletal abnormalities. Symptoms not in common with the patient include the fact that Sanfilippo Syndrome is typically associated with severe neurological decline, which is not described in the patient's presentation, and it does not typically include corneal clouding or heart murmurs.

+5 Sly Syndrome:
Sly Syndrome, or Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII (MPS VII), is a rare lysosomal storage disorder. Symptoms in common with the patient include short stature, joint stiffness, hepatomegaly, heart murmurs, and dysostosis multiplex. Symptoms not in common with the patient include the fact that Sly Syndrome often presents with more severe cognitive impairment and additional features such as umbilical or inguinal hernias, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

Common Symptoms with Patient: Memory issues, cognitive decline, mood changes, and difficulty with coordination and movement.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: CJD usually progresses more rapidly than described in the patient's condition, and there are often other neurological signs such as visual disturbances or cerebellar symptoms that are not mentioned here.

+4 Spinocerebellar Ataxia:
Spinocerebellar Ataxia is a term used for a group of hereditary ataxias that are characterized by degenerative changes in the part of the brain related to the control of movement.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Involuntary movements, difficulty with coordination, cognitive decline, and a family history of similar symptoms.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: There are many types of Spinocerebellar Ataxia, each with its own specific symptom profile. More information would be needed to match the patient's symptoms to a specific type.

+5 Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA):
DRPLA is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes involuntary movements, mental and emotional problems, and a decline in thinking ability.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Involuntary movements, cognitive decline, mood changes, and a family history of similar symptoms.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: DRPLA also often includes seizures and myoclonus, which have not been reported in this patient.

+6 Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD):
Frontotemporal Dementia is a group of disorders caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the brain's frontal lobes (the areas behind your forehead) or its temporal lobes (the regions behind your ears).
Common Symptoms with Patient: Cognitive decline, memory issues, mood changes, and changes in personality and behavior.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: The movement issues described are less common in FTD, and the pattern of inheritance may differ from what is described in the patient's family history.

+7 Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP):
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy is a rare brain disorder that causes serious problems with walking, balance, and eye movements, and can lead to issues with mood and behavior.
Common Symptoms with Patient: Movement problems, cognitive decline, and mood changes.
Uncommon Symptoms with Patient: PSP typically also includes specific eye movement abnormalities and postural instability leading to falls, which are not mentioned for this patient.

For a definitive diagnosis, further testing, including genetic testing, neuroimaging, and possibly a neurological examination, would be necessary. The patient's symptoms and family history suggest a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, and the conditions listed above are potential diagnoses that share some common features with the patient's presentation."
Mieloma múltiple,"+1 Multiple Myeloma:
Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies. Symptoms often include bone pain, anemia, frequent infections, high calcium levels, kidney dysfunction, and the presence of an abnormal protein in the blood and urine, known as a monoclonal protein or M protein. The patient's symptoms of persistent fatigue, frequent infections, unexplained weight loss, bone pain, anemia, kidney dysfunction, high calcium levels, and abnormal protein presence align with those commonly seen in multiple myeloma. The family history of similar symptoms could suggest a hereditary component, although multiple myeloma is not typically considered a genetic disease.

+2 Light Chain Deposition Disease (LCDD):
LCDD is a rare disorder characterized by the deposition of light chain proteins in various tissues, leading to organ dysfunction. Symptoms can include kidney dysfunction, which may manifest as nephrotic syndrome or renal failure, and may also involve other organs. The patient's kidney dysfunction and the presence of an abnormal protein in the blood and urine could be consistent with LCDD. However, the patient's bone pain, high calcium levels, and other symptoms are not typical for LCDD, and there is no mention of organ involvement beyond the kidneys.

+3 Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia:
This is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that involves the overproduction of IgM antibodies by malignant B cells. Symptoms can include fatigue, weight loss, and frequent infections due to the hyperviscosity of the blood caused by the excess IgM. Patients may also experience anemia and kidney problems. The patient's fatigue, weight loss, frequent infections, and anemia could be indicative of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. However, the high calcium levels and bone pain are more characteristic of other conditions, such as multiple myeloma, and Waldenström's typically involves IgM rather than the abnormal proteins described.

+4 Familial Hypercalcemia with or without Hypercalciuria:
This is a genetic condition that can lead to high levels of calcium in the blood, possibly with increased calcium excretion in the urine. Symptoms can be nonspecific but may include fatigue, bone pain, and kidney dysfunction. The patient's high calcium levels and bone pain could suggest this condition. However, the presence of an abnormal protein in the blood and urine, frequent infections, and weight loss are not typical features of familial hypercalcemia, and the patient's anemia would also need to be explained by another condition.

+5 POEMS Syndrome:
POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with plasma cell dyscrasia. The acronym POEMS stands for Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal gammopathy, and Skin changes. Patients may also experience symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, anemia, high calcium levels, and bone lesions. The patient's fatigue, weight loss, anemia, high calcium levels, and bone pain could be consistent with POEMS syndrome. However, the patient does not exhibit the full range of symptoms typically associated with this syndrome, such as polyneuropathy or organomegaly.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, multiple myeloma appears to be the most likely diagnosis, but further diagnostic testing, such as a bone marrow biopsy and imaging studies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Onfalocele,"+1 Omphalocele:
Omphalocele is a rare abdominal wall defect in which the intestines, liver, and occasionally other organs remain outside of the abdomen in a sac because of a failure in the development of the muscles of the abdominal wall. This condition is similar to what is described for the patient, as he has a sac-like structure containing parts of his small intestine and liver protruding through an abdominal wall defect. The patient's stable condition and the presence of a membrane covering the sac are also consistent with omphalocele. However, the absence of other congenital anomalies or dysmorphic features does not rule out this condition, as omphalocele can occur in isolation or with other anomalies.

+2 Gastroschisis:
Gastroschisis is another rare congenital defect where the abdominal wall does not form correctly, and the baby's intestines extend outside of the body through a hole beside the belly button. Unlike omphalocele, there is no protective sac covering the organs, and it is not associated with other congenital anomalies. The patient's symptoms do not fully align with gastroschisis because the protruding organs are contained within a thin membrane, which is not characteristic of gastroschisis.

+3 Pentalogy of Cantrell:
Pentalogy of Cantrell is a rare condition that involves five anomalies: a defect in the supraumbilical abdominal wall, a defect in the lower sternum, a deficiency of the anterior diaphragm, a deficiency of the diaphragmatic pericardium, and congenital heart anomalies. The patient's apparent abdominal wall defect could be a component of this syndrome. However, the patient does not exhibit congenital heart anomalies or other features typical of Pentalogy of Cantrell, which makes this diagnosis less likely.

+4 Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome:
Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome is a growth disorder syndrome synonymous with a range of symptoms, including an increased risk of childhood cancer, macroglossia, organomegaly, and abdominal wall defects like omphalocele. The patient's abdominal wall defect could suggest this syndrome, but the absence of macroglossia, organomegaly, and other characteristic features makes this diagnosis less likely.

+5 Prune Belly Syndrome:
Prune Belly Syndrome, also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome, is characterized by a lack of abdominal muscles, causing the skin of the belly area to wrinkle like a prune, undescended testicles, and urinary tract abnormalities. The patient does not exhibit the typical wrinkled appearance of the abdomen or other associated symptoms, making this diagnosis unlikely.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is omphalocele (+1), as the symptoms described are most consistent with this condition. However, further diagnostic tests, including imaging and genetic testing, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
"Distonía focal, segmentaria o multifocal","+1 Dystonia:
Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, which cause repetitive movements or abnormal postures. These contractions can affect a single muscle, a muscle group, or the entire body. Symptoms the patient has in common with dystonia include abnormal postures, tremors, jerkiness in movements, and cramps. The progression of symptoms and the worsening with stress or fatigue are also consistent with dystonia. However, the patient's lack of cognitive impairment and unaffected motor skills are typical for dystonia, as it primarily affects muscle control.

+2 Myoclonus:
Myoclonus refers to sudden, involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles. It's a symptom rather than a disease itself and can manifest in various conditions. The patient's jerkiness in movements and tremors align with myoclonus. However, myoclonus does not typically cause sustained abnormal postures or speech difficulties, which the patient is experiencing.

+3 Isaac's Syndrome (Neuromyotonia):
Isaac's Syndrome is characterized by continuous muscle fiber activity that leads to muscle twitching, cramps, and stiffness. The patient's symptoms of cramps and muscle spasms are consistent with this syndrome. However, Isaac's Syndrome usually does not cause abnormal postures or speech difficulties, which are present in this patient.

+4 Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS):
Stiff Person Syndrome is a rare neurological disorder with features of an autoimmune disease. It is characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and emotional distress. The patient's worsening condition with stress and the presence of muscle spasms could suggest SPS. However, the patient does not exhibit the stiffness and rigidity that are hallmarks of SPS, nor does the syndrome typically present with involuntary movements or speech difficulties.

+5 Wilson's Disease:
Wilson's Disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper accumulation in the body, leading to neurological or psychiatric symptoms. The patient's tremors could be a sign of Wilson's Disease. However, the disease typically also presents with other symptoms such as liver disease, psychiatric symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes, which the patient does not report.

+6 Multiple System Atrophy (MSA):
Multiple System Atrophy is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a combination of symptoms affecting movement, blood pressure, and other bodily functions. The patient's involuntary movements and speech difficulties could be related to MSA. However, MSA also typically includes symptoms like autonomic dysfunction and poor coordination, which the patient does not have.

+7 Huntington's Disease:
Huntington's Disease is a progressive brain disorder caused by a single defective gene on chromosome 4. It is known for causing involuntary movements (chorea), psychiatric disorders, and cognitive decline. The patient's involuntary movements could suggest Huntington's Disease, but the lack of cognitive impairment and the specific pattern of symptom progression do not align with the typical presentation of Huntington's Disease.

Given the patient's symptoms, dystonia seems to be the most likely diagnosis, but further tests, including genetic testing, MRI, and possibly electromyography (EMG), would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Fibrosis pulmonar idiopática,"'+1' Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):
IPF is a chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by scarring of the lung tissue that leads to a decline in lung function. Symptoms in common with the patient include persistent, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, clubbing of the fingers, and a pattern of interstitial lung disease with honeycombing on chest radiographs. The patient's exposure to environmental pollutants and smoking history are risk factors for IPF. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been specified, as the provided information aligns well with IPF.

'+2' Asbestosis:
Asbestosis is a lung disease resulting from the inhalation of asbestos fibers, which can cause lung scarring and shortness of breath. Symptoms in common with the patient include a history of exposure to environmental pollutants, persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, and interstitial lung disease on imaging. The patient's clubbing of the fingers and the restrictive ventilatory defect on pulmonary function tests are also consistent with asbestosis. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been specified, but a definitive diagnosis would require a history of asbestos exposure, which is not mentioned.

'+3' Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP):
HP is an immune system disorder in which the lungs become inflamed as an allergic reaction to inhaled dust, fungus, molds, or chemicals. Symptoms in common with the patient include dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and interstitial lung patterns on chest radiographs. The patient's restrictive lung disease on pulmonary function tests is also seen in HP. Symptoms not in common include the lack of improvement with antibiotics, as HP might respond to the removal of the offending antigen and the use of corticosteroids.

'+4' Sarcoidosis:
Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs but most commonly affects the lungs. Symptoms in common with the patient include persistent cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and interstitial lung patterns on imaging. Clubbing is less common in sarcoidosis, but lung involvement can lead to restrictive lung disease, which the patient has. Symptoms not in common with the patient include the presence of non-caseating granulomas on biopsy, which is a hallmark of sarcoidosis, and the patient's symptoms have not been specified to include systemic symptoms such as fever or weight loss.

'+5' Silicosis:
Silicosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling crystalline silica dust, leading to inflammation and scarring in the lungs. Symptoms in common with the patient include a history of construction work (possible silica exposure), persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, and interstitial lung patterns on chest radiographs. The patient's restrictive lung disease on pulmonary function tests is also consistent with silicosis. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been specified, but a definitive diagnosis would require a history of silica exposure, which is not clearly mentioned.

'+6' Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM):
LAM is a rare lung disease that tends to affect women and is characterized by the abnormal growth of smooth muscle cells, leading to cystic lung destruction. Symptoms in common with the patient include shortness of breath and fatigue. However, the patient's gender (male) and age are not typical for LAM, which more commonly affects women of childbearing age. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of clubbing, dry cough, and the specific pattern of interstitial lung disease with honeycombing are not typical for LAM.

'+7' Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (PLCH):
PLCH is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells in the lungs. Symptoms in common with the patient include a history of smoking, dry cough, shortness of breath, and interstitial lung patterns on imaging. However, PLCH typically presents with nodular lesions and cysts rather than honeycombing, and it is more common in younger adults. The patient's age and the specific radiographic findings are not typical for PLCH.

'+8' Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP):
PAP is a rare lung disease characterized by the accumulation of surfactant-like protein and phospholipid material within the alveoli. Symptoms in common with the patient include shortness of breath and a restrictive ventilatory defect on pulmonary function tests. However, PAP typically presents with a different pattern on imaging, such as ""crazy paving,"" and is associated with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material within the alveoli, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

The patient's presentation is most consistent with '+1' Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), given the combination of symptoms, radiographic findings, and lack of response to antibiotics. However, further diagnostic tests, such as a high-resolution CT scan and possibly a lung biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Mastocitosis sistémica,"+1 Mastocytosis:
Mastocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin and other parts of the body. Symptoms that the patient has in common with this disease include recurrent episodes of flushing, itching, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, unexplained weight loss, and elevated tryptase levels. The presence of small, brownish spots on the skin, known as mastocytomas, also aligns with cutaneous mastocytosis. The history of anaphylaxis triggered by insect stings is another common feature. Bone pain, fatigue, and osteoporosis can be associated with systemic mastocytosis, which affects multiple organs. Symptoms not in common with the disease have not been mentioned, suggesting a strong correlation with the patient's presentation.

+2 Carcinoid Syndrome:
Carcinoid syndrome occurs when a carcinoid tumor secretes certain chemicals into the bloodstream, leading to a variety of symptoms. The patient's symptoms that align with carcinoid syndrome include flushing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and unexplained weight loss. However, the presence of numerous small, brownish spots on the skin and elevated tryptase levels are not typical for carcinoid syndrome. Additionally, carcinoid syndrome usually presents with diarrhea, which the patient has not reported, and the syndrome is often associated with heart problems, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

+3 Pheochromocytoma:
Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland tissue that can cause the gland to produce too much adrenaline, leading to various symptoms. The patient's symptoms that overlap with this condition include episodes of flushing, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss. However, the presence of brownish spots on the skin, elevated tryptase levels, and a history of anaphylaxis are not typical features of pheochromocytoma. Additionally, pheochromocytoma often causes high blood pressure, which is not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

+4 Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:
Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome is a condition caused by gastrin-secreting tumors, leading to excessive gastric acid production. The patient's symptoms that match this syndrome include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Unexplained weight loss can also occur due to malabsorption. However, the presence of brownish spots on the skin, elevated tryptase levels, and a history of anaphylaxis are not associated with Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. The syndrome is also typically characterized by severe peptic ulcers, which the patient has not reported.

+5 Hereditary Angioedema:
Hereditary Angioedema is a rare genetic disorder that causes recurrent episodes of severe swelling. The patient's history of anaphylaxis could suggest a link to this condition. However, the symptoms of recurrent episodes of flushing, itching, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and the presence of brownish spots on the skin do not align with hereditary angioedema. Elevated tryptase levels are also not a feature of this disease, and the patient's family history is unremarkable, which is unusual for a hereditary condition.

Given the patient's symptoms and test results, Mastocytosis (+1) appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, such as a bone marrow biopsy and genetic testing, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Hemofilia A,"+1 Hemophilia A:
Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII, leading to excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Symptoms in common with the patient include prolonged bleeding after minor injuries, spontaneous bruising, joint swelling and pain, and prolonged bleeding after dental procedures. The family history of similar symptoms in male relatives suggests an X-linked inheritance pattern, which is consistent with Hemophilia A. Symptoms not in common with the patient include cognitive or developmental delays, which are not typically associated with Hemophilia A.

+2 Hemophilia B:
Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease, is a genetic condition caused by a deficiency of clotting factor IX. It presents similarly to Hemophilia A with symptoms such as prolonged bleeding, easy bruising, joint swelling, and pain. The patient's symptoms of prolonged bleeding after injuries and dental procedures, blood in the urine, and a family history of similar issues are consistent with Hemophilia B. There are no cognitive or developmental delays associated with Hemophilia B, which aligns with the patient's presentation.

+3 von Willebrand Disease:
von Willebrand Disease is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, which helps platelets to stick to blood vessel walls and is important for proper clotting. Symptoms in common with the patient include prolonged bleeding, spontaneous bruising, and joint swelling. However, von Willebrand Disease is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which may not fully align with the patient's family history of affected male relatives. Additionally, von Willebrand Disease can affect both males and females, whereas the patient's history suggests a disorder affecting primarily males.

+4 Glanzmann Thrombasthenia:
Glanzmann Thrombasthenia is a rare genetic platelet disorder where the platelets lack the ability to properly aggregate and form clots. Symptoms in common with the patient include prolonged bleeding, easy bruising, and bleeding after dental procedures. However, joint swelling is not a typical feature of Glanzmann Thrombasthenia, and the family history described does not fit the typical inheritance pattern of this condition, which is autosomal recessive.

+5 Factor XI Deficiency:
Factor XI Deficiency, also known as Hemophilia C, is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of clotting factor XI. It can lead to prolonged bleeding, especially after surgery or trauma. Symptoms in common with the patient include prolonged bleeding and bruising. However, joint swelling and pain are less common in Factor XI Deficiency compared to Hemophilia A or B. The inheritance pattern can be autosomal dominant or recessive, which may not fully match the patient's family history.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, Hemophilia A or B would be the most likely diagnoses to consider. Further diagnostic testing, including clotting factor assays, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate between these two conditions."
Hemofilia A,"+1 Hemophilia A:
Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII, leading to impaired blood clotting. Symptoms include prolonged bleeding after injuries or surgeries, frequent nosebleeds, spontaneous bleeding episodes, joint swelling and pain due to bleeding in the joints (hemarthrosis), and blood in the urine (hematuria). The patient's symptoms of prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, joint issues, and a family history are consistent with Hemophilia A. However, without information on specific clotting factor levels, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed.

+2 Hemophilia B:
Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease, is a genetic condition caused by a deficiency of clotting factor IX. It presents similarly to Hemophilia A, with prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, joint swelling and pain, and blood in the urine. The patient's symptoms align with Hemophilia B, and the family history suggests a possible X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. Factor IX levels would need to be measured to differentiate between Hemophilia A and B.

+3 Von Willebrand Disease:
Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF), which helps platelets to stick to the blood vessel wall and helps with the formation of a blood clot. Symptoms can include prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, and bleeding in the joints. The patient's symptoms could suggest VWD, but additional symptoms such as mucosal bleeding and menorrhagia (in females) are also common in VWD. Testing for VWF levels and function would be necessary for diagnosis.

+4 Glanzmann Thrombasthenia:
Glanzmann Thrombasthenia is a rare genetic platelet disorder where the platelets lack the ability to properly aggregate and form clots. Symptoms include prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, and easy bruising. Joint bleeding is less common than in hemophilia. The patient's symptoms of prolonged bleeding and nosebleeds could be consistent with this condition, but the presence of joint bleeding makes it less likely. Platelet function tests would be required for diagnosis.

+5 Factor XIII Deficiency:
Factor XIII Deficiency is a rare genetic bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency of clotting factor XIII. Symptoms include prolonged bleeding from wounds, spontaneous bleeding, and poor wound healing. Bleeding into the joints and muscles can occur but is less common. The patient's symptoms of prolonged bleeding and spontaneous bleeding episodes could fit this condition, but the joint involvement is not as typical. Diagnosis would require specific assays to measure factor XIII activity.

+6 Acquired Hemophilia:
Acquired hemophilia is a rare autoimmune disorder where the body develops antibodies against clotting factors, most commonly factor VIII, leading to bleeding symptoms similar to those of inherited hemophilia. It includes prolonged bleeding, spontaneous bleeding, and hematuria. However, it is typically not seen in children and does not have a genetic inheritance pattern. The patient's age and family history make this diagnosis less likely.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and family history are most suggestive of an inherited clotting disorder such as Hemophilia A or B. Further diagnostic testing, including clotting factor assays and genetic testing, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate between these conditions."
Fibrosis quística,"+1 Cystic Fibrosis:
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory and digestive systems. It is characterized by the production of thick, sticky mucus that can clog the airways and obstruct the pancreas. Symptoms in common with the patient include recurrent respiratory infections, prolonged cough, difficulty gaining weight, salty-tasting skin, and greasy, bulky stools. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been mentioned, as the provided symptoms align well with cystic fibrosis.

+2 Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia:
Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures that line the airways, ears, and other parts of the body. PCD leads to chronic respiratory tract infections, and patients may have symptoms like a chronic cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms in common with the patient include recurrent respiratory infections and prolonged cough. Symptoms not in common include the notably salty-tasting skin and the specific digestive issues such as greasy, bulky stools, which are more typical of cystic fibrosis.

+3 Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome:
Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the pancreas and bone marrow, leading to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hematological abnormalities. Symptoms in common with the patient include difficulty gaining weight, growth retardation, and greasy, bulky stools due to malabsorption. Symptoms not in common with the patient have not been explicitly mentioned, but the patient does not present with hematological abnormalities, which are typical for Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome.

+4 Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency:
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic condition that can lead to lung and liver disease. It is caused by a lack of the protein alpha-1 antitrypsin, which protects the lungs from inflammation. Symptoms in common with the patient include recurrent respiratory infections and difficulty gaining weight. Symptoms not in common with the patient include liver-related issues, which are often associated with this condition, and the patient's notably salty-tasting skin, which is not a feature of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

+5 Immotile Cilia Syndrome:
Immotile cilia syndrome, also known as Kartagener syndrome, is a subset of primary ciliary dyskinesia that includes a triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Symptoms in common with the patient include recurrent respiratory infections and chronic cough. Symptoms not in common with the patient include the absence of situs inversus (reversed organs) and chronic sinusitis, which are key features of this syndrome.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, cystic fibrosis (+1) appears to be the most likely diagnosis. However, further diagnostic tests, such as a sweat chloride test, genetic testing, and a review of the sibling's medical history, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Neuroblastoma,"+1 Neuroblastoma:
Neuroblastoma is a rare type of cancer that primarily affects infants and young children. It originates from neuroblasts, which are immature nerve cells that a fetus makes as part of its development process. The disease most commonly arises in and around the adrenal glands, which sit atop the kidneys and are part of the body's endocrine system. However, neuroblastoma can also develop in nerve tissues in the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis. The symptoms you've described, such as the abnormal growth of cells near the adrenal glands, the rapid and aggressive growth of these cells, and the genetic changes including amplification of the MYCN gene, are all consistent with neuroblastoma. Additionally, the formation of rosette-like structures and elevated levels of substances like dopamine and homovanillic acid in the blood and urine are also indicative of this disease.

+2 Pheochromocytoma:
Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland tissue. It can cause the gland to make too much of certain hormones, leading to high blood pressure and other symptoms. However, the presence of the MYCN gene amplification and the formation of rosette-like structures under microscopic examination are not typical features of pheochromocytoma. Additionally, pheochromocytomas are less common in pediatric patients and the elevated substances typically include catecholamines like norepinephrine and epinephrine, rather than specifically dopamine and homovanillic acid.

+3 Ganglioneuroblastoma:
Ganglioneuroblastoma is a rare cancer that is a type of neuroblastic tumor, which includes neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma. It contains both mature ganglion cells and immature neuroblasts, and it can be found anywhere along the sympathetic nervous system. The symptoms of an abnormal growth of cells and the location near the adrenal glands could be consistent with ganglioneuroblastoma. However, ganglioneuroblastomas are typically less aggressive than neuroblastomas and may not show the same level of rapid and aggressive growth or the same genetic changes such as MYCN amplification.

+4 Ganglioneuroma:
Ganglioneuroma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from neural crest cells and is composed of mature ganglion cells. It is usually found in the adrenal glands but can also occur in other parts of the body, such as the spine. While ganglioneuromas can cause an abnormal growth of cells, they are generally slow-growing and do not display the aggressive behavior or the specific genetic changes like MYCN amplification seen in your patient's sample. Additionally, ganglioneuromas do not typically result in elevated levels of dopamine and homovanillic acid in the blood and urine.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis from this list would be +1 Neuroblastoma, as the symptoms and characteristics of the sample closely match the typical presentation of this disease. Further diagnostic tests, such as imaging studies and a possible biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the stage and best course of treatment."
Leucemia linfoblástica aguda,"+1 Fanconi Anemia:
Fanconi anemia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the bone marrow, leading to decreased production of all types of blood cells. This can result in fatigue, easy bruising, and a higher propensity for infections and nosebleeds. Patients may also exhibit physical abnormalities, which are not mentioned in this patient's presentation. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, frequent nosebleeds, recurrent infections, sudden weight loss, pale skin, easy bruising, and abnormal white blood cell counts are consistent with Fanconi anemia. However, the absence of a family history and the lack of reported physical abnormalities or significant past medical history are not typical for Fanconi anemia.

+2 Aplastic Anemia:
Aplastic anemia is a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce sufficient amounts of blood cells. Symptoms can include fatigue, frequent infections due to low white blood cell counts, nosebleeds, and easy bruising due to reduced platelets, as well as pallor and weakness. The patient's symptoms of persistent fatigue, frequent nosebleeds, recurrent infections, sudden weight loss, pale skin, easy bruising, severe joint pain, and abnormal white blood cell counts align with aplastic anemia. However, joint pain is not a common symptom of aplastic anemia.

+3 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL):
ALL is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells and progresses rapidly. It is more common in children. Symptoms can include fatigue, frequent infections, fever, easy bruising or bleeding, bone or joint pain, and weight loss. The abnormal white blood cell count is also indicative of leukemia. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, recurrent infections, nosebleeds, weight loss, pale skin, easy bruising, and joint pain, along with abnormal blood counts, are consistent with ALL. The lack of fever and the absence of a family history do not rule out this diagnosis.

+4 Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP):
ITP is an autoimmune disorder that leads to a low platelet count, causing easy bruising, nosebleeds, and bleeding gums. Fatigue is not a typical symptom, but it can be present if the condition is severe. The patient's symptoms of easy bruising, nosebleeds, and pale skin could be related to ITP, but the recurrent infections, abnormal white blood cell counts, and joint pain are not typical for ITP.

+5 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA):
JRA is an autoimmune disorder that causes persistent joint inflammation in children. Symptoms include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, which can lead to fatigue. However, it does not typically cause nosebleeds, recurrent infections, or abnormal white blood cell counts. The patient's severe joint pain and fatigue could be attributed to JRA, but the other symptoms such as frequent nosebleeds, recurrent infections, sudden weight loss, pale skin, easy bruising, and abnormal white blood cell counts do not align with JRA.

+6 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH):
HLH is a rare disorder of the immune system causing excessive inflammation and tissue damage. Symptoms include fever, enlarged liver or spleen, cytopenias, and abnormal blood counts. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, recurrent infections, and abnormal white blood cell counts could suggest HLH. However, the lack of fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and the specific immune system findings typically seen in HLH make this diagnosis less likely.

+7 Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome:
This is a rare X-linked recessive disease characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), immune deficiency, and a higher risk of cancers and bleeding. The patient's symptoms of easy bruising, nosebleeds, and recurrent infections could be consistent with Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome. However, the absence of eczema and the fact that this condition is X-linked (and thus typically presents in males) alongside no family history make this diagnosis less likely.

Given the patient's symptoms and lab findings, further diagnostic workup is necessary, including a more detailed history, physical examination, and additional laboratory tests. Referral to a pediatric hematologist/oncologist would be appropriate for further evaluation and management."
Síndrome de Mayer-Rokitansky-KüsterHauser,"+1 Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome:
MRKH syndrome is a disorder that affects the female reproductive system. It is characterized by the underdevelopment or absence of the uterus and the upper part of the vagina. Patients with MRKH typically have normal secondary sexual characteristics and normal ovarian function, which means they go through normal puberty, developing breasts and pubic hair, but they do not have menstrual periods due to the absence of the uterus. The karyotype is typically normal (46,XX), as in the case of this patient. The patient's symptoms of never having had a menstrual period, normal secondary sexual characteristics, a short, blind-ended vagina, and absent uterus are consistent with MRKH syndrome. The periodic abdominal pain could be related to the accumulation of menstrual blood in the vaginal or pelvic area, known as hematocolpos or hematometra, if there is some form of vaginal or cervical remnant that is not patent. However, this would need further investigation as the patient has normal ovaries and no uterus.

+2 Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS):
AIS is a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. People with this condition are genetically male, with one X and one Y chromosome (46,XY), but they have a partial or complete inability to respond to androgens, the hormones responsible for male sex characteristics. As a result, they may develop mostly female physical features or signs of both male and female sexual development. Complete AIS results in a person who has external female genitalia but lacks a uterus. However, this patient's karyotype analysis showed a normal female pattern (46,XX), which does not align with AIS. Additionally, the presence of normal ovaries also argues against AIS.

+3 Swyer Syndrome:
Swyer Syndrome, also known as 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, is a condition in which individuals have an XY chromosomal pattern but develop as females with unambiguously female external genitalia. They typically do not have functional gonads (ovaries or testes), which results in the lack of onset of puberty and absence of menstruation. However, this patient has a normal 46,XX karyotype and normal ovarian function, which is not consistent with Swyer Syndrome.

+4 Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH):
CAH is a group of inherited disorders of the adrenal glands. It can cause a range of symptoms, including atypical development of the external genitalia. In females, it can lead to virilization and ambiguous genitalia. However, CAH usually presents with symptoms early in life, and this patient has normal secondary sexual characteristics and no history of ambiguous genitalia or adrenal dysfunction. Additionally, the normal 46,XX karyotype and the absence of other symptoms typically associated with CAH, such as salt-wasting or early pubic hair development, make this diagnosis less likely.

+5 Gonadal Dysgenesis (Mixed or Pure):
Gonadal dysgenesis is a condition where the gonads (ovaries or testes) do not develop properly. It can be associated with a variety of karyotypes, including 46,XX or 46,XY. Patients may have normal female external genitalia but may not experience menarche due to dysfunctional gonads. However, this patient has normal ovarian function as evidenced by the presence of normal ovaries on ultrasonography, which is not consistent with gonadal dysgenesis.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome (+1). Further evaluation and management would involve a multidisciplinary team, including gynecology, endocrinology, and potentially psychology, to address the anatomical, hormonal, and psychosocial aspects of the condition."
Síndrome de Williams,"'+1' Williams Syndrome:
Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive, elfin facial appearance, intellectual disability, a friendly and outgoing personality, and a strong interest in music. Patients often have cardiovascular disease, such as supravalvular aortic stenosis, and may experience hypercalcemia. The patient's distinct facial features, cardiovascular problems, intellectual disability, and affinity for music align with symptoms of Williams Syndrome. However, the patient's heightened auditory sensitivity and difficulty with visuospatial tasks are not classic symptoms but could be seen in some individuals with the condition.

'+2' Noonan Syndrome:
Noonan Syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause unusual facial characteristics, such as a broad forehead and a short nose, as well as heart defects, typically pulmonary stenosis rather than supravalvular aortic stenosis. Patients may also have developmental delays and mild intellectual disability. The patient's facial features and developmental issues are consistent with Noonan Syndrome, but the specific type of cardiovascular problem and the unusual affinity for music are not typical of this condition.

'+3' Velocardiofacial Syndrome (22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome):
This syndrome includes a range of features such as heart defects, characteristic facial features, and learning difficulties. Patients may have a broad nose and a small mouth, which partially matches the patient's description. They also often have a congenital heart defect, but not typically supravalvular aortic stenosis. The patient's intellectual disability and delayed development are in line with this syndrome, but the specific affinity for music and heightened auditory sensitivity are not commonly reported symptoms.

'+4' Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome:
Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome is characterized by broad thumbs and toes, short stature, distinctive facial features, and intellectual disability. While the patient does have intellectual disability and distinct facial features, the syndrome's hallmark signs of broad thumbs and toes and short stature are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. Additionally, the specific cardiovascular and auditory issues described are not typical for Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome.

'+5' Fragile X Syndrome:
Fragile X Syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. It is more common in males and is associated with a long face, large ears, and flexible joints. The patient's intellectual disability and delayed development could be indicative of Fragile X Syndrome, but the specific facial features and cardiovascular issues do not align well with this condition. Moreover, the patient's gender and the absence of other key physical traits make this diagnosis less likely.

Based on the symptoms provided, Williams Syndrome seems to be the most likely diagnosis, but further genetic testing and consultation with specialists would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
Alopecia total,"+1 Alopecia Universalis:
Alopecia Universalis is an autoimmune condition characterized by the complete loss of hair on the scalp and body. It is a severe form of Alopecia Areata. Symptoms in common with the patient: complete absence of hair on the scalp, lack of hair on other parts of the body including eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic areas. Symptoms not in common: The patient group does not report other autoimmune symptoms or systemic illnesses, which can sometimes be associated with Alopecia Universalis.

+2 Ectodermal Dysplasia:
Ectodermal Dysplasia is a group of disorders that affect the ectodermal structures, which include the skin, hair, nails, and teeth. Patients with this condition may have sparse or absent hair. Symptoms in common with the patient: lack of hair on the scalp and potentially other parts of the body. Symptoms not in common: Patients with Ectodermal Dysplasia often have other symptoms such as abnormal teeth and nail issues, which are not reported in the patient group.

+3 Hypotrichosis Simplex:
Hypotrichosis Simplex is a rare genetic condition that results in the progressive thinning and loss of scalp hair, which can lead to complete baldness. Symptoms in common with the patient: progressive hair loss leading to a complete absence of hair on the scalp. Symptoms not in common: The condition typically does not affect other body hair, which is not consistent with some patients reporting loss of eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic hair.

+4 Telogen Effluvium:
Telogen Effluvium is a temporary condition where individuals experience excessive hair shedding due to a disturbance of the normal hair growth cycle. It can result in noticeable scalp hair thinning but is usually not complete baldness. Symptoms in common with the patient: hair loss on the scalp. Symptoms not in common: Telogen Effluvium is usually a temporary condition and does not typically result in complete baldness or loss of body hair.

+5 Anagen Effluvium:
Anagen Effluvium is hair loss that occurs during the anagen or growth phase of the hair cycle, usually due to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Symptoms in common with the patient: can lead to complete hair loss on the scalp and body. Symptoms not in common: This condition is typically associated with a known trigger such as chemotherapy, which is not mentioned in the patient group.

+6 Congenital Atrichia:
Congenital Atrichia is a rare genetic disorder where hair is normal at birth but soon sheds and never regrows. Symptoms in common with the patient: complete absence of hair on the scalp and potentially other body hair. Symptoms not in common: The condition is present from birth or early infancy, which may not align with the variable age of onset in the patient group.

+7 Lichen Planopilaris:
Lichen Planopilaris is a rare inflammatory condition that leads to scarring hair loss on the scalp. Symptoms in common with the patient: hair loss on the scalp. Symptoms not in common: The condition is usually associated with inflammation and scarring, which is not described in the patient group.

Given the information provided, Alopecia Universalis seems to be the most consistent with the symptoms described in the patient group. However, further medical evaluation, including a detailed patient history, physical examination, and possibly laboratory tests or biopsies, would be necessary to confirm a diagnosis."
Hemorragia subaracnoidea aneurismática adquirida,"+1 Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome is a group of disorders that affect connective tissues and can cause symptoms such as hypermobile joints and stretchy skin. While EDS is not typically associated with sudden severe headaches or loss of consciousness, it can sometimes be linked to vascular complications that might mimic some of the patient's symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms of a sudden severe headache, temporary loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, cognitive impairment, photophobia, stiff neck, mood swings, and irritability are not typical features of EDS.

Common Symptoms with EDS: None.
Uncommon Symptoms with EDS: Sudden severe headache, temporary loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, cognitive impairment, photophobia, stiff neck, mood swings, irritability.

+2 Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA):
Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy is a condition where amyloid deposits accumulate in the walls of the brain's arteries, potentially leading to hemorrhagic stroke and cognitive decline. The patient's sudden severe headache and temporary loss of consciousness could be indicative of a hemorrhagic event. Cognitive impairment is also a symptom of CAA. However, the patient's other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, photophobia, stiff neck, mood swings, and irritability are not specific to CAA.

Common Symptoms with CAA: Sudden severe headache, temporary loss of consciousness, cognitive impairment.
Uncommon Symptoms with CAA: Nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, photophobia, stiff neck, mood swings, irritability.

+3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH):
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage is a rare but life-threatening condition where bleeding occurs between the brain and the surrounding membrane, often due to a ruptured aneurysm. The patient's symptoms of a sudden severe headache described as the worst ever, temporary loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, cognitive impairment, photophobia, and stiff neck are highly indicative of SAH. The family history of stroke at a young age could also suggest a genetic predisposition to vascular anomalies.

Common Symptoms with SAH: Sudden severe headache, temporary loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, cognitive impairment, photophobia, stiff neck.
Uncommon Symptoms with SAH: Mood swings, irritability.

+4 CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy):
CADASIL is a genetic disorder that leads to damage to the small blood vessels in the brain, causing strokes and cognitive decline. The patient's history of hypertension, cognitive impairment, and family history of stroke could be consistent with CADASIL. However, the acute presentation of a severe headache and loss of consciousness is less typical for CADASIL, which usually presents with more progressive symptoms.

Common Symptoms with CADASIL: Cognitive impairment, family history of stroke.
Uncommon Symptoms with CADASIL: Sudden severe headache, temporary loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, photophobia, stiff neck, mood swings, irritability.

+5 MELAS Syndrome (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes):
MELAS is a mitochondrial disorder that can cause stroke-like episodes, seizures, and cognitive decline. While some of the patient's symptoms such as cognitive impairment could be seen in MELAS, the acute onset of a severe headache and loss of consciousness are not typical of MELAS, which usually presents with more gradual and progressive symptoms.

Common Symptoms with MELAS: Cognitive impairment.
Uncommon Symptoms with MELAS: Sudden severe headache, temporary loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, photophobia, stiff neck, mood swings, irritability.

Given the acute presentation and the constellation of symptoms, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) appears to be the most likely diagnosis. Immediate neuroimaging, such as a CT scan or MRI, would be critical to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. It is important to note that this is a hypothetical exercise and any real-life situation would require immediate medical attention and thorough investigation by a medical professional."
Síndrome de Dravet,"+1 Dravet Syndrome:
Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy that begins in infancy. It is characterized by severe seizures often triggered by high fever, which may be the first sign. As the child grows, other types of seizures typically occur, including myoclonic seizures. Developmental delays become noticeable in the second year of life, particularly affecting language and motor skills. Ataxia and sleep disturbances are also common in Dravet syndrome. There is an increased risk of SUDEP, and patients often require extensive care. A family history of epilepsy or febrile seizures may be present, as the disorder can have a genetic component.

Common symptoms with the patient: First seizure before the age of one, often associated with high fever; decline in language and motor skills around the age of two; high frequency of prolonged and recurrent seizures; ataxia; sleep disturbances; higher prevalence of SUDEP; round-the-clock care required; family history of epilepsy or febrile seizures.
Symptoms not in common with the patient: The description provided does not mention specific seizure types such as myoclonic seizures, which are typical in Dravet syndrome.

+2 Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome:
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy that appears during childhood, typically between the ages of 3 and 5 years. It is characterized by multiple types of seizures, including tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. Intellectual development is usually affected, and behavioral problems are common. Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may also experience a decline in cognitive function and have difficulties with motor skills. Ataxia and sleep disturbances can occur, and there is an increased risk of injuries due to falls from seizures. SUDEP is also a concern in these patients.

Common symptoms with the patient: Decline in language and motor skills; high frequency of prolonged and recurrent seizures; ataxia; sleep disturbances; higher prevalence of SUDEP; round-the-clock care required.
Symptoms not in common with the patient: The age of onset for the first seizure is typically between 3 and 5 years, not before the age of one as described in the patient's symptoms. The specific types of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are not mentioned in the patient's description.

+3 Rett Syndrome:
Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological disorder that primarily affects girls and is usually identified in the second year of life. It is characterized by normal early growth and development followed by a slowing of development, loss of purposeful use of the hands, distinctive hand movements such as wringing and washing, slowed brain and head growth, problems with walking, seizures, and intellectual disability. Sleep disturbances can occur, and some patients may have a history of epilepsy in their family.

Common symptoms with the patient: Decline in language and motor skills around the age of two; recurrent seizures; sleep disturbances.
Symptoms not in common with the patient: Rett syndrome primarily affects girls and includes distinctive hand movements and a slowing of head growth, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. The first seizure typically does not occur before the age of one in Rett syndrome.

+4 Ohtahara Syndrome:
Ohtahara syndrome is an extremely rare and severe form of epilepsy that occurs in neonates, often within the first three months of life. It is characterized by frequent and severe seizures, including tonic spasms, and a characteristic EEG pattern. Infants with Ohtahara syndrome typically have very poor prognosis, with high rates of mortality and profound developmental delays. There is often a progressive decline in neurological function.

Common symptoms with the patient: First seizure before the age of one; decline in motor skills; high frequency of prolonged and recurrent seizures; higher prevalence of SUDEP; round-the-clock care required.
Symptoms not in common with the patient: The onset of seizures in Ohtahara syndrome is typically within the first three months of life, and the seizures are often tonic spasms, which are not specifically mentioned in the patient's symptoms. The decline in language skills is not a typical feature of Ohtahara syndrome.

Please note that these are potential rare diseases based on the symptoms provided, and further medical evaluation, including genetic testing and detailed clinical history, would be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis."
