- **Propionic Acidemia** and **Methylmalonic Acidemia** are severe metabolic disorders that often present in the neonatal period with metabolic acidosis, which can lead to death in infancy if not treated promptly.
- **Isovaleric Acidemia** also presents with metabolic acidosis and elevated carboxylic acids but may have a slightly different clinical course, with some cases surviving beyond the neonatal period.
- **Glutaric Acidemia Type I**, **3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA Carboxylase Deficiency**, **Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency**, and **Ethylmalonic Encephalopathy** are associated with elevated urinary carboxylic acids but may not consistently lead to neonatal or infant death, depending on severity and management.
