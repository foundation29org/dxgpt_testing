Síndrome de Down,"+1. Down Syndrome: This is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features, and mild to moderate intellectual disability. The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8 or 9-year-old child, but this varies widely. The symptoms that match with the patient's condition include distinct facial features, cognitive delays, hypotonia, short stature, sociability, routine-based task affinity, and health complications like heart defects and gastrointestinal abnormalities.

+2. Turner Syndrome: This is a chromosomal condition that alters development in females. Women with this condition tend to be shorter than average and are usually unable to conceive a child (infertile) because of an absence of ovarian function. Other symptoms of this condition that are not present in the patient's condition include lymphedema (swelling in the hands and feet) and a broad chest with widely spaced nipples.

+3. Prader-Willi Syndrome: This is a complex genetic condition that affects many parts of the body. In infancy, this condition is characterized by weak muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding difficulties, poor growth, and delayed development. Beginning in childhood, affected individuals develop an insatiable appetite, which leads to chronic overeating (hyperphagia) and obesity. Some symptoms that match with the patient's condition include hypotonia and cognitive delays. However, the patient does not exhibit symptoms of overeating and obesity.

+4. Williams Syndrome: This is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body.

These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day. In a typical sleep cycle, we enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis, which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy. Common symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone while awake), sleep paralysis, and hallucinations. The patient's symptoms align with this disease as he experiences excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks. However, he does not report any cataplexy, sleep paralysis, or hallucinations.

However, heavier-than-normal menstrual periods and stress-induced headaches are not typical symptoms of this disease.

+3. Von Willebrand Disease: This is a lifelong bleeding disorder in which your blood doesn't clot well. Symptoms in common with the patient include unusual bruising, spontaneous nosebleeds, and a heavier-than-normal menstrual period. However, fatigue, a pale complexion, low platelet count, and stress-induced headaches are not typical symptoms of Von Willebrand Disease.

+4. Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS): These are a group of disorders caused by poorly formed blood cells or ones that don't work properly. Symptoms in common with the patient include unusual bruising, spontaneous nosebleeds, fatigue, and a pale complexion. The patient's low platelet count could also be a sign of MDS. However, a heavier-than-normal menstrual period and stress-induced headaches are not typical symptoms of this disease. 

+5. Essential Thrombocythemia (ET): This is a rare chronic disease where the bone marrow produces too many platelets. It can lead to blood clotting or bleeding. Symptoms in common with the patient include unusual bruising, spontaneous nosebleeds, fatigue, and a heavier-than-normal menstrual period. However, the patient's low platelet count contradicts the typical high platelet count in ET patients, and stress-induced headaches are not a typical symptom."
Narcolepsia tipo 1,"+1. Narcolepsy: This is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day. In a typical sleep cycle, we enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis, which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy. Common symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations. The patient's symptoms align with this diagnosis.

+2. Hypersomnia: This is a condition where a person has excessive daytime sleepiness and struggles to stay awake during the day. They may fall asleep at any time, for example, while working or driving. They may also have other sleep-related problems, including a lack of energy and trouble thinking clearly. While the patient does exhibit excessive daytime sleepiness, she does not show other common symptoms such as prolonged nighttime sleep or difficulty waking up, which are common in hypersomnia.

+3. Sleep Paralysis: This is a state, during waking up or falling asleep, in which a person is aware but unable to move or speak. During an episode, one may hallucinate (hear, feel, or see things that are not there), which often results in fear. Episodes generally last less than a couple of minutes. The patient's symptoms of sleep paralysis and hallucinations align with this diagnosis, but the excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy are not common symptoms of sleep paralysis.

+4. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: This sleep disorder involves abnormal behaviors emerging during the REM sleep phase. People with REM sleep behavior disorder may act out their dreams. Symptoms include movement and vocal sounds during sleep, and recall of dream content. While the patient does experience vivid and frightening dreams, she does not exhibit physical movement or vocal sounds during sleep, which are common symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder. 

+5. Cataplexy: This is a sudden and uncontrollable muscle weakness or paralysis that comes on during the day and is often triggered by a strong emotion, such as excitement or laughter. The loss of muscle tone can be a slight weakness in a limited number of muscles, such as a slight drooping of the eyelids, or can result in the total collapse of the body. While the patient does exhibit cataplexy, she also has other symptoms that are not common in isolated cataplexy cases, such as excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep paralysis.","+1. Narcolepsy: This is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), which are symptoms the patient has. Sleep paralysis and hallucinations are also common symptoms of narcolepsy, which the patient experiences. Disrupted night-time sleep is another symptom of narcolepsy that the patient has. However, narcolepsy is not typically associated with food allergies, which the patient reports.

+2. Hypersomnia: This is a condition characterized by excessive sleepiness, regardless of how much sleep an individual gets at night. The patient's excessive daytime sleepiness could be a symptom of hypersomnia. However, hypersomnia does not typically include symptoms such as cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, which the patient experiences. Also, disrupted night-time sleep is not a common symptom of hypersomnia.

+3. Sleep Paralysis: This is a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. The patient's episodes of sleep paralysis align with this condition. However, sleep paralysis does not typically include symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and hallucinations, which the patient experiences. Also, disrupted night-time sleep and food allergies are not associated with sleep paralysis.

+4. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: This is a sleep disorder where you physically act out vivid, often unpleasant dreams with vocal sounds and sudden, often violent arm and leg movements during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. The patient's hallucinations could be a symptom of this disorder. However, the patient does not report physically acting out dreams, which is a key symptom of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder. Also, excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, disrupted night-time sleep, and food allergies are not typically associated with this disorder. 

+5. Cataplexy: This is a sudden and uncontrollable muscle weakness or paralysis that comes on during the day and is often triggered by a strong emotion. The patient's sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions aligns with this condition. However, cataplexy is usually a symptom of narcolepsy and does not occur on its own. Also, excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, disrupted night-time sleep, and food allergies are not typically associated with cataplexy.","+1. Narcolepsy: This is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day. In a typical sleep cycle, we initially enter the early stages of sleep followed by deeper sleep stages and ultimately (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis, which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy. Common symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations. The patient's symptoms align with this diagnosis.

+2. Kleine-Levin Syndrome: This is a rare disorder characterized by the need for excessive amounts of sleep (hypersomnia), (often up to 20 hours a day); changes in behavior and cognition during episodes; and overeating. Some individuals may also have a hypersexual behavior. These symptoms are episodic and may last for days, weeks, or months during which time all normal daily activities stop. Individuals are not able to care for themselves or attend school and work. In between episodes, those with KLS appear to be in perfect health with no evidence of behavioral or physical dysfunction. KLS episodes may be related to malfunctions in the hypothalamus and thalamus, parts of the brain that control appetite and sleep. This disease does not fully align with the patient's symptoms as she does not exhibit overeating or hypersexual behavior.

+3. Hypersomnia: This is a neurological disorder of excessive time spent sleeping or excessive sleepiness. It can have many possible causes and can cause distress and problems with functioning. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), hypersomnia appears under sleep-wake disorders as hypersomnolence disorder. The patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness align with this diagnosis, but the sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), sleep paralysis, and hallucinations are not typical symptoms of hypersomnia.","+1. Narcolepsy: This is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep attacks may occur during any type of activity at any time of the day.

For people suffering from narcolepsy, REM sleep occurs almost immediately in the sleep cycle, as well as periodically during the waking hours. It is in REM sleep that we can experience dreams and muscle paralysis, which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy may cause serious disruptions in your daily routine. Symptoms the patient has in common: excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), sleep paralysis, vivid dream-like hallucinations during the onset of sleep, disrupted nighttime sleep. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: none mentioned.

+2. Hypersomnia: This is a condition where a person has excessive daytime sleepiness and trouble staying awake during the day. They may fall asleep at inappropriate times, such as while at work or while driving. The main symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), in which a person feels a persistent sense of fatigue and often falls asleep during the day. However, each person may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms the patient has in common: excessive daytime sleepiness, disrupted nighttime sleep. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: no mention of falling asleep at inappropriate times.

+3. Kleine-Levin Syndrome: This is a rare disorder characterized by the need for excessive amounts of sleep (hypersomnia), (often up to 20 hours a day); changes in behavior and a reduced understanding of the world. The disorder strikes adolescents primarily but can occur in younger children and adults. Individuals experiencing an episode of Kleine Levin Syndrome may go for a period of weeks, months or even years without experiencing any symptoms, and then suddenly fall into an episode. Symptoms the patient has in common: excessive daytime sleepiness, disrupted nighttime sleep. Symptoms the patient does not have in common: no mention of changes in behavior or a reduced understanding of the world, no mention of long periods without symptoms.","+1. Narcolepsy: This is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness.

+2. Kleine-Levin Syndrome: This is a rare disorder characterized by the need for excessive amounts of sleep (hypersomnia), (often up to 20 hours a day); changes in behavior and cognition during episodes; and overeating. Some individuals may also have an abnormally uninhibited sexual drive. However, the patient does not exhibit symptoms of overeating or hypersexuality, making this diagnosis less likely.

+3. Idiopathic Hypersomnia: This is a sleep disorder characterized by chronic and excessive daytime sleepiness that persists despite adequate, or even excessive, nighttime sleep. People with idiopathic hypersomnia often have difficulty waking up after sleeping (sleep inertia) and may feel groggy for hours. This condition does not involve sudden sleep attacks or loss of muscle control in response to strong emotions, which are symptoms present in the patient, making this diagnosis less likely. 

+4. Sleep Apnea: This is a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. Symptoms often include excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, and episodes of stopped breathing during sleep. However, the patient does not report snoring or episodes of stopped breathing, making this diagnosis less likely. 

+5. REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: This is a sleep disorder in which you physically act out vivid, often unpleasant dreams with vocal sounds and sudden, often violent arm and leg movements during REM sleep — sometimes called dream-enacting behavior. However, the patient does not report acting out dreams, making this diagnosis less likely.","+1. Narcolepsy: This is a neurological disorder that affects the control of sleep and wakefulness. People with narcolepsy experience excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime.

However, the reported food allergies are not a common symptom of narcolepsy.

+2. Kleine-Levin Syndrome: This is a rare disorder characterized by the need for excessive amounts of sleep (hypersomnia), (often up to 20 hours a day); changes in behavior and cognition during episodes; and overeating. Some individuals may also have a hypersexual behavior. These symptoms are episodic. The person appears to be in good health between episodes. The patient's excessive daytime sleepiness could be a symptom of this syndrome, but the lack of overeating, behavioral changes, and hypersexual behavior do not align with this diagnosis.

+3. Hypersomnia: This is a neurological disorder of excessive time spent sleeping or excessive sleepiness. It can have many possible causes and can cause distress and problems with functioning. Symptoms include sleeping for unusually long periods (up to 20 hours), difficulty waking up, disorientation, anxiety, decreased energy, restlessness, slow thinking or speech, loss of appetite, hallucinations, and memory difficulty. The patient's excessive daytime sleepiness and vivid dream-like experiences could be symptoms of this disorder, but the lack of other symptoms such as difficulty waking up, disorientation, and slow thinking do not align with this diagnosis. The reported food allergies are also not a common symptom of hypersomnia."
Colangitis biliar primaria,"+1. Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC): This is a chronic disease that slowly destroys the bile ducts in the liver, leading to scarring and liver failure. Symptoms include fatigue, pruritus, jaundice, and discomfort in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen.

The patient's symptoms align with this disease, except for the hyperactivity, attention deficits, and occasional insomnia which are not common symptoms of SMEI.

+4. SCN1A-related seizure disorders: These are a group of disorders caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene. Symptoms can range from mild febrile seizures to severe epilepsy syndromes like Dravet syndrome. The patient's symptoms align with this disease, except for the occasional insomnia which is not a common symptom of SCN1A-related seizure disorders.","+1. Dravet Syndrome: This is a rare and catastrophic form of intractable epilepsy that begins in infancy. Symptoms include prolonged seizures often triggered by high body temperature or fever, developmental delay, speech impairment, ataxia, hypotonia, sleep disturbances, and behavioral disorders. The patient's recurrent, prolonged seizures, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, ataxia, and resistance to antiepileptic drugs are consistent with this syndrome. However, the onset of seizures in Dravet Syndrome typically occurs earlier, around the first year of life.

+2. Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome: This is a type of epilepsy with multiple different types of seizures, particularly tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. Intellectual development often slows or regresses. Other symptoms include behavior problems, and delayed motor skills. The patient's recurrent, prolonged seizures, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and resistance to antiepileptic drugs align with this syndrome. However, the patient does not exhibit tonic or atonic seizures.

+3. Doose Syndrome: Also known as Myoclonic-Astatic Epilepsy, it is characterized by a variety of seizure types with a childhood onset. Symptoms include myoclonic seizures, astatic seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and atypical absences. Developmental delay and behavioral issues may also be present. The patient's recurrent, prolonged seizures, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and resistance to antiepileptic drugs are consistent with this syndrome. However, the patient does not exhibit myoclonic, astatic, or atypical absence seizures.

+4. Rett Syndrome: This is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects girls and leads to severe cognitive and physical impairments. Symptoms include seizures, slowed growth, loss of purposeful hand skills, and problems with movements, coordination, and balance. The patient's recurrent, prolonged seizures, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and ataxia align with this syndrome. However, the patient does not exhibit loss of purposeful hand skills or slowed growth.

+5. West Syndrome: This is a rare epileptic disorder in infants. The syndrome is age-related, generally occurring between the third and the twelfth month of life. Symptoms include a specific pattern of seizures known as infantile spasms, developmental regression, and a specific pattern on electroencephalography (EEG) testing called hypsarrhythmia. The patient's recurrent, prolonged seizures, developmental delay, and cognitive impairment are consistent with this syndrome. However, the patient does not exhibit infantile spasms or hypsarrhythmia on EEG.","+1. Dravet Syndrome: This is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy that begins in infancy. Symptoms include prolonged seizures often triggered by high body temperature or fever, developmental delay, and ataxia. The seizures are often resistant to treatment. The patient's symptoms align with this disease, however, hyperactivity and insomnia are not typically associated with Dravet Syndrome.

+2. Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome: This is a type of epilepsy with multiple different types of seizures, particularly tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. Intellectual development often slows or regresses. This could explain the patient's cognitive impairment and developmental delay. However, this syndrome usually begins between ages 3 and 5 years, which is later than the onset of this patient's symptoms. Hyperactivity and insomnia are not common symptoms.

+3. Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy: This is a condition that involves seizures beginning in infancy or, in some cases, before birth. These seizures are resistant to typical antiepileptic drugs but respond to large daily doses of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). Developmental delay and cognitive impairment are common in this condition. However, hyperactivity and insomnia are not typically associated with this condition.

+4. Rett Syndrome: This is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects girls and leads to severe cognitive and physical impairments. Symptoms include seizures, ataxia, and developmental delay. However, Rett Syndrome is typically characterized by a period of normal development followed by a loss of purposeful hand skills and slowed growth, which does not align with this patient's symptoms. Hyperactivity and insomnia are common in Rett Syndrome.

+5. West Syndrome: This is a rare epileptic disorder seen in infancy and early childhood. The syndrome is age-related, generally occurring between the third and the twelfth month of life, which aligns with the patient's age of onset. Symptoms include a specific type of seizure known as infantile spasms, developmental regression, and cognitive impairment. However, hyperactivity and insomnia are not typically associated with West Syndrome."
