\n\n+1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): AKI is a sudden and severe decline in kidney function, often caused by dehydration, infection, or medication. The patient's difficulty in diuresis and lack of fever, vomiting, or abdominal pain are consistent with AKI. However, the patient's normal physical examination and negative PPR tests do not support this diagnosis.

\n\n+2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): UTI is a bacterial infection that affects the urinary tract, often causing symptoms such as burning during urination, frequent urination, and abdominal pain. The patient's difficulty in diuresis and polyuria are consistent with UTI, but the lack of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain are not typical symptoms.

\n\n+3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA is a life-threatening complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of ketones. The patient's lack of glucose and diuresis data makes it difficult to confirm or rule out DKA, but the patient's polyuria and polydipsia are consistent with this diagnosis.

\n\n+4. Electrolyte Imbalance: Electrolyte imbalances can cause a range of symptoms, including difficulty in diuresis, polyuria, and polydipsia. The patient's normal physical examination and negative PPR tests do not support this diagnosis, but further testing may be necessary to rule out an electrolyte imbalance.

\n\n+5. Medication-Induced Nephrotoxicity: Certain medications can cause kidney damage or toxicity, leading to difficulty in diuresis and polyuria. The patient's medical history and medication list are not provided, making it difficult to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.

\n\n+6. Prerenal Azotemia: Prerenal azotemia is a condition that occurs when the kidneys are not receiving enough blood flow or oxygen, leading to kidney damage. The patient's normal physical examination and negative PPR tests do not support this diagnosis, but further testing may be necessary to rule out prerenal azotemia.

\n\n+7. Post-Obstructive Diuresis: Post-obstructive diuresis is a condition that occurs when the kidneys are suddenly relieved of obstruction, leading to a sudden increase in urine production. The patient's difficulty in diuresis and polyuria are consistent with this diagnosis, but the lack of a clear history of obstruction makes it difficult to confirm.

\n\n+1. Viral Laryngitis: This is a common viral infection that affects the larynx, causing inflammation and swelling of the vocal cords. The patient's symptoms of a catarrhal state, hyperemia of the oropharynx, and tympanic membrane inflammation are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's normal abdominal examination and lack of fever or respiratory distress do not align with typical symptoms of viral laryngitis.

\n\n+2. Acute Otitis Media: This is a common bacterial infection that affects the middle ear, causing inflammation and pus accumulation. The patient's symptoms of tympanic membrane inflammation and normal abdominal examination are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of fever, respiratory distress, and normal lung sounds do not align with typical symptoms of acute otitis media.

\n\n+3. Pharyngitis: This is an inflammation of the pharynx, often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The patient's symptoms of a catarrhal state, hyperemia of the oropharynx, and normal abdominal examination are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of fever, respiratory distress, and normal lung sounds do not align with typical symptoms of pharyngitis.

\n\n+4. Tonsillitis: This is an inflammation of the tonsils, often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The patient's symptoms of a catarrhal state, hyperemia of the oropharynx, and normal abdominal examination are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of fever, respiratory distress, and normal lung sounds do not align with typical symptoms of tonsillitis.

\n\n+5. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection: This is a common viral infection that affects the respiratory tract, causing inflammation and congestion. The patient's symptoms of a catarrhal state, hyperemia of the oropharynx, and normal abdominal examination are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of fever, respiratory distress, and normal lung sounds do not align with typical symptoms of RSV infection.

\n\n+6. Adenovirus Infection: This is a common viral infection that affects the respiratory tract, causing inflammation and congestion. The patient's symptoms of a catarrhal state, hyperemia of the oropharynx, and normal abdominal examination are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of fever, respiratory distress, and normal lung sounds do not align with typical symptoms of adenovirus infection.

Please note that a more comprehensive evaluation, including laboratory tests and imaging studies, would be necessary to confirm a specific diagnosis."

ORL AFONIA, Exploracion Compl.: NaN, Evolucion: NaN","Based on the patient's symptoms and diagnosis, I've compiled a list of potential diseases with a short description, indicating which symptoms the patient has in common with each disease and which symptoms they do not have in common.

\n\n+1. Laryngitis: Laryngitis is an inflammation of the vocal cords, often caused by viral or bacterial infections. The patient's symptoms of disphonia (hoarseness) and afonia (loss of voice) are common with laryngitis. However, the patient's absence of fever and lack of improvement with Algidol treatment are not typical of laryngitis.

\n\n+2. Acute Laryngeal Trauma: Acute laryngeal trauma can cause hoarseness, loss of voice, and difficulty speaking. The patient's symptoms of disphonia and afonia are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's absence of trauma or injury to the larynx is not mentioned in the patient's history.

\n\n+3. Chronic Laryngeal Disease: Chronic laryngeal disease, such as chronic laryngitis or laryngeal papillomatosis, can cause persistent hoarseness and loss of voice. The patient's symptoms of disphonia and afonia are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's recent onset of symptoms and lack of prior history of chronic laryngeal disease make this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+4. Thyroid Disease: Thyroid disease, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, can cause changes in the voice, including hoarseness and loss of voice. The patient's symptoms of disphonia and afonia are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's absence of other typical symptoms of thyroid disease, such as weight changes or fatigue, makes this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+5. Neurological Disorder: Certain neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, can cause changes in the voice, including hoarseness and loss of voice. The patient's symptoms of disphonia and afonia are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's absence of other typical symptoms of neurological disorders, such as tremors or weakness, makes this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+6. Allergic Reaction: An allergic reaction to a substance, such as an inhalant or food, can cause hoarseness and loss of voice. The patient's symptoms of disphonia and afonia are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's absence of other typical symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as itching or hives, makes this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+7. Medication Side Effect: Certain medications, such as antibiotics or antihistamines, can cause changes in the voice, including hoarseness and loss of voice. The patient's symptoms of disphonia and afonia are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's absence of other typical symptoms of medication side effects, such as dizziness or nausea, makes this diagnosis less likely.

Based on the patient's symptoms and diagnosis, I would recommend further evaluation and testing to determine the underlying cause of their disphonia and afonia."

\n\n+1. Viral Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and chest tightness are consistent with viral pneumonia. The patient's chest X-ray shows a slight increase in density in the left lung, which could be indicative of pneumonia. However, the patient's white blood cell count and other laboratory results do not show any significant abnormalities.

\n\n+2. Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms are also consistent with bacterial pneumonia, although the patient's chest X-ray does not show any clear infiltrates in the lung parenchyma. The patient's white blood cell count and other laboratory results do not show any significant abnormalities.

\n\n+3. Influenza: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and sore throat are consistent with influenza. The patient's rapid antigen test for influenza was negative, but this does not rule out the possibility of influenza.

\n\n+4. Pneumococcal Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms are consistent with pneumococcal pneumonia, although the patient's chest X-ray does not show any clear infiltrates in the lung parenchyma. The patient's white blood cell count and other laboratory results do not show any significant abnormalities.

\n\n+5. Legionnaires' Disease: The patient's symptoms are consistent with Legionnaires' disease, although the patient's chest X-ray does not show any clear infiltrates in the lung parenchyma. The patient's white blood cell count and other laboratory results do not show any significant abnormalities.

\n\n+6. SARS-CoV-2 Infection: The patient's symptoms are consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the patient's rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The patient's chest X-ray shows a slight increase in density in the left lung, which could be indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

\n\n+7. Other Respiratory Viruses: The patient's symptoms are consistent with other respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or human metapneumovirus (HMPV). The patient's rapid antigen test for these viruses was negative, but this does not rule out the possibility of infection with one of these viruses.

In terms of symptoms that the patient has in common with each of these potential diseases, the patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and chest tightness are consistent with all of these diseases. The patient's symptoms of sore throat and headache are more consistent with influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting are more consistent with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In terms of symptoms that the patient does not have in common with each of these potential diseases, the patient does not have any symptoms of severe respiratory distress, such as shortness of breath or wheezing, which is more consistent with bacterial pneumonia and Legionnaires' disease. The patient does not have any symptoms of severe headache or stiff neck, which is more consistent with meningitis."

\n\n+1. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): IBS is a chronic condition characterized by recurring abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea are common in IBS. However, the patient's lack of vomiting and normal bowel habits do not fit with the typical presentation of IBS.

\n\n+2. Gastroenteritis: Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, often caused by viral or bacterial infections. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain are consistent with gastroenteritis. However, the patient's lack of fever and normal vital signs do not fit with the typical presentation of severe gastroenteritis.

\n\n+3. Stress-Induced Gastrointestinal Symptoms: The patient's history of similar episodes in relation to periods of increased stress suggests that their symptoms may be stress-induced. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain are common in stress-induced gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the patient's lack of other symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath does not fit with the typical presentation of a stress-induced event.

\n\n+4. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): IBD is a chronic condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea are common in IBD. However, the patient's lack of other symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, and rectal bleeding do not fit with the typical presentation of IBD.

\n\n+5. Food Poisoning: Food poisoning is an acute illness caused by eating contaminated food. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain are consistent with food poisoning. However, the patient's lack of other symptoms such as vomiting and fever do not fit with the typical presentation of severe food poisoning.

\n\n+6. Viral Gastroenteritis: Viral gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines caused by a viral infection. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain are consistent with viral gastroenteritis. However, the patient's lack of fever and normal vital signs do not fit with the typical presentation of severe viral gastroenteritis.

\n\n+7. Functional Dyspepsia: Functional dyspepsia is a chronic condition characterized by recurring symptoms of upper abdominal discomfort, bloating, and nausea. The patient's symptoms of nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are common in functional dyspepsia. However, the patient's lack of other symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation do not fit with the typical presentation of functional dyspepsia.

Here is the list of potential diseases with a short description, along with the symptoms the patient has in common with each disease and those they do not have in common:

\n\n+1. Nasal Fracture: A nasal fracture is a common injury that occurs when the nasal bone is broken or crushed. Symptoms may include swelling, bruising, and pain in the nose. The patient has a traumatismo nasal, which is consistent with a nasal fracture. However, the patient does not have epistaxis (nosebleed), which is a common symptom of a nasal fracture.

\n\n+2. Soft Tissue Injury: Soft tissue injuries, such as bruises and lacerations, are common in children who engage in physical altercations. The patient has hematomas on the mucosa of the lower lip and erosions on the mentum, which are consistent with soft tissue injuries. However, the patient does not have any open wounds or lacerations.

\n\n+3. Dental Trauma: Dental trauma can occur when a child is involved in a physical altercation and bites or is bitten by another child. The patient has an erosion on the upper gum on the right side, which could be consistent with dental trauma. However, the patient's dental examination is normal, which suggests that the erosion may not be related to dental trauma.

\n\n+4. Infection: Infections, such as cellulitis or abscesses, can occur as a result of soft tissue injuries. The patient has a normal oral examination, which suggests that there is no evidence of an infection. However, the patient's temperature is 36.0°C, which is slightly elevated, and their oxygen saturation is 96.0%, which is slightly decreased. These findings could be consistent with a mild infection.

\n\n+5. Allergic Reaction: Allergic reactions can cause swelling, bruising, and pain in the face. The patient has an erosion on the upper gum on the right side, which could be consistent with an allergic reaction. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms that are typical of an allergic reaction, such as itching, hives, or difficulty breathing.

\n\n+6. Mucocutaneous Disorder: Mucocutaneous disorders, such as aphthous stomatitis or mucous membrane pemphigoid, can cause erosions and ulcers in the mouth. The patient has erosions on the mentum and upper gum on the right side, which could be consistent with a mucocutaneous disorder. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms that are typical of these disorders, such as fever, fatigue, or joint pain.

Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is a soft tissue injury, such as a bruise or laceration, caused by the physical altercation. However, further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms."

\n\n+1. Pneumonia: Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in the lungs, causing symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. The patient does not have a fever, but they do have difficulty breathing and a cough. The patient's chest X-ray is normal, which is not consistent with pneumonia.

\n\n+2. Pleurisy: Pleurisy is an inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs, which can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing. The patient has intercostal chest pain that worsens with inspiration, which is consistent with pleurisy. However, the patient does not have a fever or cough, which are common symptoms of pleurisy.

\n\n+3. Pulmonary Embolism: Pulmonary embolism is a blockage of the pulmonary arteries, which can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing. The patient has intercostal chest pain that worsens with inspiration, which is consistent with pulmonary embolism. However, the patient's chest X-ray is normal, which is not consistent with pulmonary embolism.

\n\n+4. Pneumothorax: Pneumothorax is a collapse of a lung, which can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing. The patient has intercostal chest pain that worsens with inspiration, which is consistent with pneumothorax. However, the patient's chest X-ray is normal, which is not consistent with pneumothorax.

\n\n+5. Interstitial Lung Disease: Interstitial lung disease is a group of lung disorders that can cause scarring and inflammation in the lungs, leading to symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The patient has intercostal chest pain that worsens with inspiration, which is consistent with interstitial lung disease. However, the patient's chest X-ray is normal, which is not consistent with interstitial lung disease.

\n\n+6. Cardiac Disease: Cardiac disease can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing, especially if there is a blockage in the coronary arteries. The patient's electrocardiogram is normal, which suggests that cardiac disease is unlikely.

\n\n+7. Musculoskeletal Disorder: Musculoskeletal disorders can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing, especially if there is a strain or sprain in the chest muscles. The patient's physical examination is normal, which suggests that a musculoskeletal disorder is unlikely.

\n\n+8. Anxiety Disorder: Anxiety disorders can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing, especially if the patient is experiencing anxiety or panic attacks. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with an anxiety disorder, as they do not have a history of anxiety or panic attacks.

\n\n+9. Other Causes: Other causes of chest pain and difficulty breathing include gastrointestinal disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and neurological disorders, such as a panic attack. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with these causes, as they do not have a history of gastrointestinal or neurological disorders.

Based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is pleurisy. However, further testing and evaluation are needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms."

Here is the list of potential diseases with a short description, along with the symptoms that the patient has in common with each disease and those that they do not have in common:

\n\n+1. Viral Laryngitis: This is a common viral infection that causes inflammation of the larynx, leading to hoarseness, cough, and fever. The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and redness of the oropharynx are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have a runny nose or congestion, which is often present in viral laryngitis.

\n\n+2. Acute Bronchitis: This is a common respiratory infection that causes inflammation of the bronchial tubes, leading to cough, fever, and wheezing. The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, and normal lung sounds are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have wheezing or shortness of breath, which are often present in acute bronchitis.

\n\n+3. Pneumonia: This is a serious infection that causes inflammation of the lungs, leading to fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and normal lung sounds are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have difficulty breathing or chest pain, which are often present in pneumonia.

\n\n+4. Influenza: This is a viral infection that causes fever, cough, and body aches. The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and normal lung sounds are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have body aches or fatigue, which are often present in influenza.

\n\n+5. Tonsillitis: This is an infection of the tonsils, which can cause sore throat, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. The patient's symptoms of fever, sore throat, and redness of the oropharynx are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have swollen lymph nodes or difficulty swallowing, which are often present in tonsillitis.

\n\n+6. Pharyngitis: This is an infection of the pharynx, which can cause sore throat, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. The patient's symptoms of fever, sore throat, and redness of the oropharynx are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have swollen lymph nodes or difficulty swallowing, which are often present in pharyngitis.

\n\n+7. Sinusitis: This is an infection of the sinuses, which can cause fever, cough, and facial pain. The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and normal lung sounds are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have facial pain or nasal congestion, which are often present in sinusitis.

\n\n+8. Laryngotracheitis: This is an infection of the larynx and trachea, which can cause hoarseness, cough, and fever. The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and redness of the oropharynx are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have stridor or difficulty breathing, which are often present in laryngotracheitis.

It is important to note that these are just potential diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, and further testing and evaluation may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."

\n\n+1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): A bacterial infection that affects the urinary tract, often causing symptoms such as disuria, polyuria, and urinary frequency. The patient's symptoms of disuria and polyuria are consistent with UTI, but the absence of fever, abdominal pain, and nausea/vomiting is unusual. The patient's urinalysis results, including the presence of leukocytes and nitrites, support this diagnosis.

\n\n+2. Interstitial Cystitis: A chronic inflammatory condition that affects the bladder, causing symptoms such as disuria, polyuria, and pelvic pain. The patient's symptoms of disuria and polyuria are consistent with interstitial cystitis, but the absence of pelvic pain and other symptoms such as dyspareunia and urinary incontinence is unusual.

\n\n+3. Overactive Bladder: A condition characterized by sudden, intense contractions of the bladder muscle, leading to symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence. The patient's symptoms of disuria and polyuria are consistent with overactive bladder, but the absence of urinary incontinence and other symptoms such as nocturia and frequency is unusual.

\n\n+4. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): A non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, often causing symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia. The patient's symptoms of disuria and polyuria are not typical of BPH, as it usually affects older men and is characterized by symptoms such as hesitancy, weak stream, and incomplete emptying.

\n\n+5. Kidney Stones: A condition characterized by the formation of small, hard mineral deposits in the kidneys, often causing symptoms such as severe pain, nausea/vomiting, and frequent urination. The patient's symptoms of disuria and polyuria are not typical of kidney stones, as they usually present with severe pain and other symptoms.

\n\n+6. Neurogenic Bladder: A condition characterized by abnormal bladder function due to neurological disorders such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease. The patient's symptoms of disuria and polyuria are not typical of neurogenic bladder, as they usually present with other symptoms such as urinary incontinence, retention, and constipation.

\n\n+7. Bladder Cancer: A type of cancer that affects the bladder, often causing symptoms such as hematuria, dysuria, and frequency. The patient's symptoms of disuria and polyuria are not typical of bladder cancer, as they usually present with other symptoms such as hematuria and pelvic pain.

Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). However, further testing and evaluation are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes."

\n\n+1. Bronquiolitis Aguda: The patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing, wheezing, and rapid breathing are consistent with bronchiolitis. The patient's age and recent diagnosis of otitis/Bronquiolitis Aguda incipiente also support this diagnosis. The patient's fever, cough, and diarrhea are also common symptoms of bronchiolitis. However, the patient's lack of wheezing in the posterior regions and the improvement in respiratory sounds after nebulization are not typical of bronchiolitis.

\n\n+2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing, fever, and cough are consistent with pneumonia. The patient's recent diagnosis of otitis/Bronquiolitis Aguda incipiente and the presence of wheezing in the anterior regions also support this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of chest pain and the absence of focal findings on examination are not typical of pneumonia.

\n\n+3. Asthma: The patient's symptoms of wheezing, rapid breathing, and difficulty breathing are consistent with asthma. The patient's recent diagnosis of otitis/Bronquiolitis Aguda incipiente and the presence of wheezing in the anterior regions also support this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of a personal or family history of asthma and the absence of wheezing in the posterior regions are not typical of asthma.

\n\n+4. Foreign Body Aspiration: The patient's symptoms of wheezing, rapid breathing, and difficulty breathing are consistent with foreign body aspiration. The patient's recent diagnosis of otitis/Bronquiolitis Aguda incipiente and the presence of wheezing in the anterior regions also support this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of a history of choking or coughing up a foreign object and the absence of focal findings on examination are not typical of foreign body aspiration.

\n\n+5. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient's symptoms of cough, wheezing, and rapid breathing are consistent with GERD. The patient's recent diagnosis of otitis/Bronquiolitis Aguda incipiente and the presence of wheezing in the anterior regions also support this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of a history of regurgitation or heartburn and the absence of focal findings on examination are not typical of GERD.

\n\n+6. Croup: The patient's symptoms of hoarseness, stridor, and difficulty breathing are consistent with croup. The patient's recent diagnosis of otitis/Bronquiolitis Aguda incipiente and the presence of wheezing in the anterior regions also support this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of a history of recent upper respiratory tract infection and the absence of focal findings on examination are not typical of croup.

\n\n+7. Epiglottitis: The patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing, fever, and cough are consistent with epiglottitis. The patient's recent diagnosis of otitis/Bronquiolitis Aguda incipiente and the presence of wheezing in the anterior regions also support this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of a history of recent upper respiratory tract infection and the absence of focal findings on examination are not typical of epiglottitis.

Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is bronchiolitis. However, it is important to note that the patient's symptoms are not typical of bronchiolitis, and further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."

\n\n+1. Gastroenteritis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting are consistent with a viral or bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's fever, which has resolved, and the presence of pharyngeal congestion and rhinitis also support this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of fever and the absence of blood in the stool or vomit do not fit with a severe case of gastroenteritis.

\n\n+2. Appendicitis: The patient's abdominal pain, particularly in the left lower quadrant, and the presence of tenderness in the same area are consistent with appendicitis. However, the patient's lack of fever, nausea, and vomiting do not fit with a typical case of appendicitis.

\n\n+3. Intussusception: The patient's abdominal pain, particularly in the left lower quadrant, and the presence of tenderness in the same area are consistent with intussusception. However, the patient's lack of fever, nausea, and vomiting do not fit with a typical case of intussusception.

\n\n+4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, particularly in the left upper quadrant, and the presence of regurgitation and vomiting are consistent with GERD. However, the patient's lack of heartburn and regurgitation of food do not fit with a typical case of GERD.

\n\n+5. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, particularly in the left lower quadrant, and the presence of diarrhea and vomiting are consistent with IBD. However, the patient's lack of fever, weight loss, and the absence of blood in the stool or vomit do not fit with a typical case of IBD.

\n\n+6. Viral gastroenteritis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting are consistent with a viral infection of the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's fever, which has resolved, and the presence of pharyngeal congestion and rhinitis also support this diagnosis.

\n\n+7. Bacterial gastroenteritis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting are consistent with a bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's fever, which has resolved, and the presence of pharyngeal congestion and rhinitis also support this diagnosis.

\n\n+8. Food poisoning: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting are consistent with food poisoning. The patient's fever, which has resolved, and the presence of pharyngeal congestion and rhinitis also support this diagnosis.

\n\n+9. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, particularly in the left upper quadrant, and the presence of nausea and vomiting are consistent with pancreatitis. However, the patient's lack of fever, abdominal tenderness, and the absence of blood in the stool or vomit do not fit with a typical case of pancreatitis.

\n\n+10. Intestinal obstruction: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, particularly in the left lower quadrant, and the presence of vomiting are consistent with intestinal obstruction. However, the patient's lack of fever, abdominal tenderness, and the absence of blood in the stool or vomit do not fit with a typical case of intestinal obstruction.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is viral gastroenteritis. However, further testing and evaluation are needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms."

\n\n+1. Conjunctivitis: The patient presents with a red left eye, which is a common symptom of conjunctivitis. The patient does not have any other symptoms that are typically associated with conjunctivitis, such as discharge or pain. The patient's normal pupillary reaction and absence of other ocular abnormalities on examination also suggest that conjunctivitis is a possible diagnosis.

\n\n+2. Uveitis: The patient's red left eye and normal pupillary reaction are also consistent with uveitis. However, the patient's lack of pain or discharge and normal conjunctiva on examination make it less likely that uveitis is the primary diagnosis.

\n\n+3. Allergic reaction: The patient's recent exercise and lack of other symptoms suggest that an allergic reaction may be a possible cause of the red eye. However, the patient's normal pupillary reaction and absence of other ocular abnormalities on examination make it less likely that an allergic reaction is the primary diagnosis.

\n\n+4. Subconjunctival hemorrhage: The patient's red left eye and normal pupillary reaction are consistent with a subconjunctival hemorrhage. However, the patient's lack of pain or discharge and normal conjunctiva on examination make it less likely that a subconjunctival hemorrhage is the primary diagnosis.

\n\n+5. Corneal ulcer: The patient's red left eye and normal pupillary reaction are consistent with a corneal ulcer. However, the patient's lack of pain or discharge and normal conjunctiva on examination make it less likely that a corneal ulcer is the primary diagnosis.

\n\n+6. Blepharitis: The patient's red left eye and normal pupillary reaction are consistent with blepharitis. However, the patient's lack of pain or discharge and normal conjunctiva on examination make it less likely that blepharitis is the primary diagnosis.

\n\n+7. Keratitis: The patient's red left eye and normal pupillary reaction are consistent with keratitis. However, the patient's lack of pain or discharge and normal conjunctiva on examination make it less likely that keratitis is the primary diagnosis.

\n\n+8. Iridocyclitis: The patient's red left eye and normal pupillary reaction are consistent with iridocyclitis. However, the patient's lack of pain or discharge and normal conjunctiva on examination make it less likely that iridocyclitis is the primary diagnosis.

\n\n+9. Chalazion: The patient's red left eye and normal pupillary reaction are consistent with a chalazion. However, the patient's lack of pain or discharge and normal conjunctiva on examination make it less likely that a chalazion is the primary diagnosis.

\n\n+10. Hordeolum: The patient's red left eye and normal pupillary reaction are consistent with a hordeolum. However, the patient's lack of pain or discharge and normal conjunctiva on examination make it less likely that a hordeolum is the primary diagnosis.

Based on the patient's symptoms and examination, I believe that conjunctivitis or uveitis are the most likely diagnoses. Further testing and examination would be necessary to determine the specific cause of the patient's symptoms."

\n\n+5. Sinusitis: The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, and ear pain are consistent with sinusitis. However, the patient's lack of nasal congestion, facial pain, and purulent discharge make this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+6. Otitis media: The patient's symptoms of ear pain and fever are consistent with otitis media. However, the patient's lack of ear discharge or difficulty hearing make this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+7. Pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes: The patient's symptoms of fever, sore throat, and adenopathy are consistent with streptococcal pharyngitis. However, the patient's lack of a positive rapid strep test and the absence of other typical symptoms such as cervical lymphadenitis make this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+8. Influenza: The patient's symptoms of fever, sore throat, and adenopathy are consistent with influenza. However, the patient's lack of cough, difficulty breathing, and the absence of other typical symptoms such as myalgia and arthralgia make this diagnosis less likely.

The patient's age and lack of fever also support this diagnosis. The patient does not have diarrhea, which is unusual for viral gastroenteritis, but this could be due to the patient's age or the fact that the patient is already receiving hydration. The patient's otalgia and otoscopy findings are not typical of viral gastroenteritis, but could be related to a separate condition.

\n\n+2. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain could be related to chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. The patient's age and lack of fever are consistent with this diagnosis.

\n\n+4. Allergic Rhinitis: Allergic rhinitis is a type of rhinitis caused by an allergic reaction to environmental allergens, such as pollen, dust, or pet dander. The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, runny nose, and cough are consistent with allergic rhinitis. However, the patient's symptoms of red eyes and conjunctivitis are not typical of allergic rhinitis.

\n\n+5. Viral Laryngitis: Viral laryngitis is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the larynx, leading to symptoms such as hoarseness, cough, and wheezing. The patient's symptoms of cough and wheezing are consistent with viral laryngitis. However, the patient's symptoms of red eyes and conjunctivitis are not typical of viral laryngitis.

\n\n+6. Sinusitis: Sinusitis is an inflammation of the paranasal sinuses, which can be caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, cough, and wheezing are consistent with sinusitis. However, the patient's symptoms of red eyes and conjunctivitis are not typical of sinusitis.

These are just a few potential diseases that the patient may have based on their symptoms. A more thorough examination and diagnostic testing would be necessary to determine the exact cause of the patient's symptoms."

Here is the list:

\n\n+1. Osteosarcoma: The patient's symptoms of persistent chest pain, hipocondrio pain, and loss of weight are common in osteosarcoma patients. However, the patient does not have symptoms such as fever, chills, or night sweats, which are often present in osteosarcoma patients.

\n\n+2. Metastatic bone disease: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, hipocondrio pain, and loss of weight are consistent with metastatic bone disease. The patient's TAC findings of altered bone density and focal lesions are also consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have symptoms such as bone fractures or pathologic fractures, which are often present in patients with metastatic bone disease.

\n\n+3. Multiple myeloma: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, hipocondrio pain, and loss of weight are common in multiple myeloma patients.

\n\n+1. Migraine: The patient's history of chronic cefalea and the current symptoms of cefalea, nauseas, and vomitos are consistent with a migraine episode. The patient's Glasgow score of 15 and normal neurological examination also support this diagnosis. However, the patient does not have a headache aura, which is a common feature of migraines.

\n\n+2. Tension-type headache: The patient's cefalea, nauseas, and vomitos could also be attributed to a tension-type headache. However, the patient's medical history of chronic cefalea and the lack of other symptoms such as neck or shoulder pain, which are common in tension-type headaches, make this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+3. Medication-overuse headache: The patient's history of chronic cefalea and the recent treatment with petidina may indicate medication-overuse headache. However, the patient's symptoms do not seem to be consistent with this diagnosis, as they do not have a history of frequent or prolonged use of pain medication.

\n\n+4. Sinusitis: The patient's cefalea and nauseas could be caused by sinusitis, especially given the patient's history of chronic cefalea. However, the patient's normal neurological examination and lack of other symptoms such as facial pain or pressure, which are common in sinusitis, make this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+5. Temporomandibular joint disorder: The patient's cefalea and nauseas could also be caused by temporomandibular joint disorder, especially given the patient's history of chronic cefalea. However, the patient's normal neurological examination and lack of other symptoms such as jaw pain or clicking, which are common in temporomandibular joint disorder, make this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+6. Hypertension: The patient's cefalea and nauseas could be caused by hypertension, especially given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms. However, the patient's normal blood pressure and lack of other symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath, which are common in hypertension, make this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+7. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: The patient's cefalea and nauseas could be caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms. However, the patient's normal neurological examination and lack of other symptoms such as headache worsening with coughing or straining, which are common in subarachnoid hemorrhage, make this diagnosis less likely.

\n\n+8. Meningitis: The patient's cefalea and nauseas could be caused by meningitis, especially given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms. However, the patient's normal neurological examination and lack of other symptoms such as fever, which are common in meningitis, make this diagnosis less likely.

Here is the list:

\n\n+1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): 
The patient's symptoms of disurea, polyuria, and pain in the hypogastrium are common in UTIs. However, the patient does not have fever or vomiting, which are typical symptoms of UTIs. The patient's medical history of being treated with antibiotics (Monurol, Ciprofloxacino, and penicilina) may indicate that the UTI has been treated, but the symptoms persist.

\n\n+2. Chronic Kidney Disease: 
The patient's symptoms of disurea and polyuria could be indicative of chronic kidney disease. However, the patient's normal blood pressure and normal physical examination findings do not strongly support this diagnosis.

\n\n+3. Diabetic Nephropathy: 
The patient's symptoms of disurea and polyuria could be related to diabetic nephropathy, especially given the patient's age and lack of other obvious causes for the symptoms. However, the patient's glucose levels are not reported, making it difficult to confirm this diagnosis.

\n\n+4. Interstitial Cystitis: 
The patient's symptoms of disurea, polyuria, and pain in the hypogastrium are common in interstitial cystitis. However, the patient's normal physical examination findings and lack of other symptoms such as pelvic pain or abnormal urinalysis results do not strongly support this diagnosis.

\n\n+5. Overactive Bladder: 
The patient's symptoms of disurea and polyuria could be related to overactive bladder. However, the patient's normal physical examination findings and lack of other symptoms such as urinary incontinence or urgency do not strongly support this diagnosis.

\n\n+6. Prostatitis: 
The patient's symptoms of disurea, polyuria, and pain in the hypogastrium could be related to prostatitis, especially given the patient's age and male sex. However, the patient's normal physical examination findings and lack of other symptoms such as fever or chills do not strongly support this diagnosis.

\n\n+7. Pyelonephritis: 
The patient's symptoms of disurea, polyuria, and pain in the hypogastrium could be related to pyelonephritis, especially given the patient's medical history of being treated with antibiotics. However, the patient's normal physical examination findings and lack of other symptoms such as fever or chills do not strongly support this diagnosis.

Here's the list:

\n\n+1. Quadriceps Tendinitis: Quadriceps tendinitis is an inflammation of the quadriceps tendon, which connects the quadriceps muscle to the kneecap. The patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs, especially in the anterior region, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of frequent exercise and insertion of the quadriceps tendon may also contribute to the development of tendinitis. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as swelling, redness, and warmth suggests that this diagnosis may not be the most likely.

\n\n+2. Muscle Strain: Muscle strain is a common condition characterized by a tear in the muscle fibers. The patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs, especially in the anterior region, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of frequent exercise and insertion of the quadriceps tendon may also contribute to the development of muscle strain. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as swelling, redness, and warmth suggests that this diagnosis may not be the most likely.

\n\n+3. Bursitis: Bursitis is an inflammation of the fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that cushion the joints and reduce friction between moving parts. The patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs, especially in the anterior region, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of frequent exercise and insertion of the quadriceps tendon may also contribute to the development of bursitis. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as swelling, redness, and warmth suggests that this diagnosis may not be the most likely.

\n\n+4. Osteitis Pubis: Osteitis pubis is an inflammation of the pubic bone, which can cause pain in the groin and thigh area. The patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs, especially in the anterior region, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as swelling, redness, and warmth suggests that this diagnosis may not be the most likely.

\n\n+5. Stress Fracture: Stress fracture is a small crack in the bone, often caused by repetitive stress or overuse. The patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs, especially in the anterior region, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of frequent exercise and insertion of the quadriceps tendon may also contribute to the development of stress fracture. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as swelling, redness, and warmth suggests that this diagnosis may not be the most likely.

\n\n+6. Compartment Syndrome: Compartment syndrome is a condition in which increased pressure within a confined space (compartment) compromises blood flow and can cause pain, numbness, and weakness. The patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs, especially in the anterior region, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as numbness, weakness, and paresthesia suggests that this diagnosis may not be the most likely.

\n\n+7. Tendinosis: Tendinosis is a chronic degenerative condition characterized by the breakdown of tendons. The patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs, especially in the anterior region, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of frequent exercise and insertion of the quadriceps tendon may also contribute to the development of tendinosis. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as swelling, redness, and warmth suggests that this diagnosis may not be the most likely.

\n\n+8. Myositis: Myositis is an inflammation of the muscle tissue. The patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs, especially in the anterior region, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as swelling, redness, and warmth suggests that this diagnosis may not be the most likely.

\n\n+9. Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage and bone. The patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs, especially in the anterior region, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as stiffness, limited mobility, and joint deformity suggests that this diagnosis may not be the most likely.

\n\n+10. Neurological Disorder: Neurological disorders such as sciatica, piriformis syndrome, or lumbar radiculopathy can cause pain in the thigh area. The patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs, especially in the anterior region, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's lack of symptoms such as numbness, weakness, and paresthesia suggests that this diagnosis may not be the most likely.

Here is the list of potential diseases with a short description, along with the symptoms they have in common and those they do not have in common:

\n\n+1. Cervical Spondylosis: Cervical spondylosis is a degenerative condition that affects the joints and discs in the neck, leading to pain and stiffness. The patient's symptoms of cervicalgia, localized pain over the middle and lower trapezius fibers, and preserved mobility and strength in the muscles of the neck and shoulders are consistent with this condition. However, the patient's lack of trauma history and normal lordosis on examination do not fit with this diagnosis.

\n\n+2. Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread muscle pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. The patient's symptoms of cervicalgia and preserved mobility and strength in the muscles of the neck and shoulders are not typical of fibromyalgia, which often presents with widespread pain and tender points.

\n\n+3. Herniated Disc: A herniated disc in the cervical spine can cause pain and stiffness in the neck and arm. The patient's symptoms of cervicalgia, localized pain over the middle and lower trapezius fibers, and preserved mobility and strength in the muscles of the neck and shoulders are consistent with this condition. However, the patient's normal lordosis on examination and lack of trauma history do not fit with this diagnosis.

\n\n+4. Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition that affects the joints, leading to pain and stiffness. The patient's symptoms of cervicalgia, localized pain over the middle and lower trapezius fibers, and preserved mobility and strength in the muscles of the neck and shoulders are consistent with this condition. However, the patient's lack of trauma history and normal lordosis on examination do not fit with this diagnosis.

\n\n+5. Thoracic Outlet Syndrome: Thoracic outlet syndrome is a condition that occurs when the nerves and blood vessels in the neck and shoulder are compressed, leading to pain and numbness in the arm. The patient's symptoms of cervicalgia and preserved mobility and strength in the muscles of the neck and shoulders are not typical of thoracic outlet syndrome, which often presents with numbness and tingling in the arm.

\n\n+6. Whiplash Injury: Whiplash injury is a type of neck strain that occurs when the neck is suddenly and forcefully extended or flexed, leading to pain and stiffness. The patient's symptoms of cervicalgia, localized pain over the middle and lower trapezius fibers, and preserved mobility and strength in the muscles of the neck and shoulders are consistent with this condition. However, the patient's lack of trauma history does not fit with this diagnosis.

Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, I would recommend further evaluation with imaging studies, such as an MRI or CT scan, to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities in the neck. Additionally, a thorough physical examination and review of the patient's medical history may help to identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to their symptoms."

Rx torax: infiltrados en base derecha. Senos costofrenicos libres., Evolucion: NaN","Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I have identified several potential diseases that may be causing their condition. Here are some of the possibilities:

\n\n+1. Influenza: The patient's symptoms of sore throat, cough, and chest pain are consistent with influenza. Additionally, the patient's age and the fact that they have family members with similar symptoms suggest that influenza may be a possibility. However, the patient's lack of fever and nausea/vomiting symptoms are not typical of influenza.

\n\n+2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest pain and cough could be indicative of pneumonia. The patient's age and the fact that they have family members with similar symptoms also suggest that pneumonia may be a possibility. However, the patient's lack of fever and the negative SARS-CoV-2 test result make pneumonia less likely.

\n\n+3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient's chronic cough and chest pain could be indicative of COPD. The patient's age and the fact that they have family members with similar symptoms also suggest that COPD may be a possibility. However, the patient's lack of wheezing and the negative SARS-CoV-2 test result make COPD less likely.

\n\n+4. Asthma: The patient's cough and chest pain could be indicative of asthma. The patient's age and the fact that they have family members with similar symptoms also suggest that asthma may be a possibility. However, the patient's lack of wheezing and the negative SARS-CoV-2 test result make asthma less likely.

\n\n+5. Viral pharyngitis: The patient's sore throat and cough could be indicative of viral pharyngitis. The patient's age and the fact that they have family members with similar symptoms also suggest that viral pharyngitis may be a possibility. However, the patient's lack of fever and the negative SARS-CoV-2 test result make viral pharyngitis less likely.

\n\n+6. Mononucleosis: The patient's sore throat, fever, and swollen lymph nodes could be indicative of mononucleosis. However, the patient's lack of fatigue and the negative SARS-CoV-2 test result make mononucleosis less likely.

\n\n+7. Sinusitis: The patient's sore throat and cough could be indicative of sinusitis. The patient's age and the fact that they have family members with similar symptoms also suggest that sinusitis may be a possibility. However, the patient's lack of fever and the negative SARS-CoV-2 test result make sinusitis less likely.

\n\n+8. Tonsillitis: The patient's sore throat and cough could be indicative of tonsillitis. The patient's age and the fact that they have family members with similar symptoms also suggest that tonsillitis may be a possibility. However, the patient's lack of fever and the negative SARS-CoV-2 test result make tonsillitis less likely.

\n\n+9. Laryngitis: The patient's sore throat and hoarseness could be indicative of laryngitis. The patient's age and the fact that they have family members with similar symptoms also suggest that laryngitis may be a possibility. However, the patient's lack of fever and the negative SARS-CoV-2 test result make laryngitis less likely.

\n\n+10. Allergic reaction: The patient's symptoms of sore throat, cough, and chest pain could be indicative of an allergic reaction. However, the patient's lack of fever and the negative SARS-CoV-2 test result make an allergic reaction less likely.

It is important to note that these are just potential diagnoses and that a definitive diagnosis can only be made through further testing and evaluation."

\n\n+1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient presents with chest pain, which is a common symptom of ACS. The fact that the pain is not relieved by oral analgesia and worsens with movement is also consistent with ACS. However, the patient's normal blood pressure, heart rate, and lack of dyspnea or other symptoms of cardiac distress make ACS less likely.

\n\n+2. Costochondritis: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, especially in the sternum, are consistent with costochondritis. The fact that the pain worsens with movement and is not relieved by oral analgesia is also consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's normal ECG and lack of other symptoms such as fever or cough make costochondritis less likely.

\n\n+3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms of chest pain, especially in the sternum, are consistent with PE. The fact that the patient is afebrile and has no other symptoms such as dyspnea or cough makes PE less likely. However, the patient's normal ECG and lack of other symptoms such as hemoptysis or syncope make PE less likely.

\n\n+4. Pneumothorax: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, especially in the sternum, are consistent with pneumothorax. The fact that the patient is afebrile and has no other symptoms such as dyspnea or cough makes pneumothorax less likely. However, the patient's normal ECG and lack of other symptoms such as hemoptysis or syncope make pneumothorax less likely.

\n\n+5. Musculoskeletal Chest Pain: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, especially in the sternum, are consistent with musculoskeletal chest pain. The fact that the patient has no other symptoms such as fever or cough and has a normal ECG makes musculoskeletal chest pain a possible diagnosis.

\n\n+6. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient's symptoms of chest pain, especially in the sternum, are consistent with GERD. The fact that the patient has no other symptoms such as dyspnea or cough and has a normal ECG makes GERD a possible diagnosis.

\n\n+7. Anxiety Disorder: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, especially in the sternum, are consistent with anxiety disorder. The fact that the patient has no other symptoms such as fever or cough and has a normal ECG makes anxiety disorder a possible diagnosis.

\n\n+8. Hyperventilation Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, especially in the sternum, are consistent with hyperventilation syndrome. The fact that the patient has no other symptoms such as fever or cough and has a normal ECG makes hyperventilation syndrome a possible diagnosis.

It is important to note that these are just potential diagnoses and further testing and evaluation are needed to confirm the diagnosis."
