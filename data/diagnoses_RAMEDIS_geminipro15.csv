+1. **Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency (OTCD):** This is a genetic disorder that affects the urea cycle, leading to the buildup of ammonia in the blood. 

  * **Symptoms in common:** Hyperammonemia, vomiting, cerebral edema, lethargy (which can progress to coma), hypotonia, death in infancy/childhood/adolescence.
  * **Symptoms not in common:** Eczematoid dermatitis, skin rash, fever, gastrointestinal inflammation, recurrent viral infections. 

+2. **Argininosuccinate Synthetase Deficiency (Citrullinemia Type I):** Another urea cycle disorder causing ammonia accumulation.

  * **Symptoms in common:** Hyperammonemia, vomiting, cerebral edema, lethargy (which can progress to coma), hypotonia, death in infancy/childhood/adolescence, elevated plasma citrulline.
  * **Symptoms not in common:** Eczematoid dermatitis, skin rash, fever, gastrointestinal inflammation, recurrent viral infections.

+3. **Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency (Argininosuccinic Aciduria):**  This urea cycle disorder leads to the buildup of argininosuccinic acid in the body.

  * **Symptoms in common:** Hyperammonemia, vomiting, cerebral edema, lethargy (which can progress to coma), hypotonia, death in infancy/childhood,  
  * **Symptoms not in common:** Eczematoid dermatitis, skin rash, fever, gastrointestinal inflammation, recurrent viral infections, elevated plasma citrulline.

+4.  **Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD):**  This is a broader category encompassing various enzyme deficiencies in the urea cycle. 

  * **Symptoms in common:**  Many UCDs share symptoms like hyperammonemia, vomiting, lethargy, hypotonia, and developmental delays. 
  * **Symptoms not in common:** The specific symptoms can vary depending on the exact enzyme deficiency.  

+5. **Organic Acidemia:**  This group of disorders involves problems breaking down certain amino acids, leading to a buildup of organic acids in the body.

  * **Symptoms in common:**  Symptoms can include vomiting, lethargy, hypotonia, developmental delays, and metabolic acidosis.
  * **Symptoms not in common:** The specific symptoms vary depending on the type of organic acidemia. 

+6. **Methylmalonic Acidemia:** This is a type of organic acidemia that affects the body's ability to process certain fats and proteins.

  * **Symptoms in common:** Symptoms can include vomiting, lethargy, hypotonia, developmental delays, and metabolic acidosis.
  * **Symptoms not in common:** The specific symptoms and severity can vary.
