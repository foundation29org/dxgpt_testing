Fractura de collarbone (Clavicle Fracture): A common bone injury caused by a fall or direct blow to the shoulder. The patient presents localized pain and swelling at the affected area. In this case, the patient reports a traumatism to the right hand, but the description mentions a fracture in the right upper arm (3rd metacarpal bone), so this diagnosis might not be accurate based on the given information. However, it's worth considering as a possibility.

+2. Strain or Sprain: Soft tissue injuries caused by overstretching or tearing of ligaments or muscles. The patient presents localized pain and swelling, which could be indicative of a strain or sprain. However, the absence of joint instability or bruising might argue against this diagnosis.

+3. Contusion (Bruise): A localized injury caused by blunt trauma, resulting in the rupture of small blood vessels beneath the skin. The patient presents localized pain and swelling, which could be indicative of a contusion. However, the absence of discoloration (bruising) might argue against this diagnosis.

+4. Dislocation: The displacement of a bone from its normal position in a joint. The patient presents localized pain and swelling, but there is no mention of joint instability or deformity, which makes this diagnosis less likely.

+5. Tendonitis: Inflammation of a tendon, often caused by repetitive motion or injury. The patient does not present any specific symptoms related to tendonitis, such as pain with movement or crepitus.

+6. Nerve injury: Damage to a nerve, often caused by trauma or compression. The patient does not present any specific symptoms related to nerve injury, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness.

+7. Infection: An invasion of an organ or body part by pathogenic microorganisms. The patient does not present any specific symptoms related to infection, such as fever, chills, or increased heart rate.

+8. Fracture of the scaphoid bone: A common wrist bone injury caused by a fall onto an outstretched hand. The patient does not present any specific symptoms related to this diagnosis, but the absence of mention of wrist pain or tenderness might argue against it.

+9. Carpal tunnel syndrome: A condition caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. The patient does not present any specific symptoms related to this diagnosis, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in the hand.

+10. Gout: A form of arthritis caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in a joint. The patient does not present any specific symptoms related to gout, such as joint pain, redness, or swelling, especially during the night or after a period of inactivity.

Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis is a fracture of the 3rd metacarpal bone in the right hand. However, it's important to note that further evaluation, such as X-rays, would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities."

Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient presents with symptoms of disuria and polydipsia, which are common in UTIs. The presence of leucocytosis and pyuria in the urinalysis supports this diagnosis. However, the absence of abdominal pain and fever below 38°C suggests a lower urinary tract infection, such as a bladder infection.

+2. Prostatitis: The patient is a male over 50 years old, which puts him at risk for prostatitis. The symptoms of disuria and polydipsia can be associated with this condition. However, the absence of lower back pain, fever above 38°C, and prostate tenderness on digital rectal examination would argue against this diagnosis.

+3. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's glucose level was not measured in the given data, but the presence of polydipsia and a high creatinine level (1.11 mg/dL) could suggest diabetes mellitus. However, the absence of other symptoms such as polyuria, polyphagia, and polydipsia would make this diagnosis less likely.

+7. Bladder Cancer: The patient's age and symptoms could suggest bladder cancer, but the absence of hematuria, dysuria, and other symptoms would make this diagnosis less likely.

+8. Neurogenic Bladder: The patient's specialty is emergency medicine, and the presence of disuria and polydipsia could suggest a neurogenic bladder. However, the absence of other symptoms such as urinary retention, incontinence, or impotence would make this diagnosis less likely.

+9. Interstitial Cystitis: The patient's symptoms of disuria and polydipsia could suggest interstitial cystitis. However, the absence of other symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain would make this diagnosis less likely.

+10. Overactive Bladder: The patient's symptoms of disuria and polydipsia could suggest an overactive bladder. However, the absence of other symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and incontinence would make this diagnosis less likely."

Concussion: The patient has experienced a head injury and reports symptoms of headache, cervicalgia, and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, indicating no loss of consciousness or vomiting. Neurological examination reveals isocoric and normoreactive pupils, normal cranial nerve function, intact cerebellar function, and normal reflexes. The patient is alert and oriented.

+2. Meningitis: The patient has a head injury and reports a headache. However, the absence of fever, neck stiffness, or altered mental status argues against meningitis. The patient's neurological examination is normal, with intact cranial nerves, normal reflexes, and normal cerebellar function.

+3. Subdural Hematoma: The patient has a head injury and reports a headache. The absence of focal neurological deficits, altered mental status, or vomiting makes this less likely. However, the patient's age and the presence of a cervical spine injury increase the risk of subdural hematoma. Imaging studies would be necessary to rule this out.

Pleurisy: A male patient of 58 years old presenting with left intercostal pain that worsens with inspiration, without cough, dyspnea, or expectoration, could be suggestive of pleurisy. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the pleura, causing pain with breathing. The patient's normal temperature, oxygen saturation, and chest X-ray results support this diagnosis.

+2. Costochondritis: This condition, characterized by inflammation of the costochondral joints, could also be a possibility. The patient's age, sex, and localized pain with inspiration are common symptoms. However, the absence of cough, dyspnea, or fever might argue against this diagnosis.

+3. Pulmonary Embolism: Although the patient's chest pain is localized and not accompanied by shortness of breath, dyspnea, or hemoptysis, a pulmonary embolism cannot be completely ruled out based on the given information. However, the normal D-dimer level and chest X-ray results make this diagnosis less likely.

+4. Pneumonia: The patient's age, sex, and chest pain make pneumonia a possibility. However, the absence of cough, dyspnea, or fever, as well as normal oxygen saturation and chest X-ray results, make this diagnosis less likely.

+5. Musculoskeletal Strain: Given the patient's age and localized pain, a musculoskeletal strain could also be considered. However, the absence of reported trauma or overexertion makes this diagnosis less likely.

+6. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Although the patient does not report any gastrointestinal symptoms, it is essential to consider GERD as a possibility, especially given the patient's age and sex. However, the absence of reported abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting makes this diagnosis less likely.

+7. Anxiety or Panic Attack: The patient's symptoms could be related to anxiety or a panic attack, as the pain is localized and not accompanied by other respiratory symptoms. However, the absence of reported shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, or sweating makes this diagnosis less likely.

+8. Myocardial Infarction: Although the patient's electrocardiogram was not mentioned in the provided information, myocardial infarction should be considered as a possibility given the patient's age, sex, and chest pain. However, the absence of reported shortness of breath, dyspnea, or diaphoresis makes this diagnosis less likely.

+9. Pericarditis: Pericarditis could also be considered as a possibility given the patient's age, sex, and chest pain. However, the absence of reported fever, malaise, or pericardial friction rub makes this diagnosis less likely.

+10. Esophageal Spasm: Esophageal spasm is another possibility, given the patient's age and sex, and the localized chest pain. However, the absence of reported dysphagia, heartburn, or regurgitation makes this diagnosis less likely.

+11. Aortic Dissection: Although the patient's blood pressure and electrocardiogram were not mentioned in the provided information, aortic dissection should be considered as a possibility given the patient's age, sex, and chest pain. However, the absence of reported sudden severe pain, paralysis, or neurological symptoms makes this diagnosis less likely.

However, the patient does not report a high fever or a hoarse voice, which are also common symptoms of croup.

+6. Foreign body aspiration: This is the inhalation of a foreign object into the airway. The patient presents with sudden onset of difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, and stridor, which are common symptoms of foreign body aspiration. However, the patient does not report a history of choking or coughing up foreign material.

+7. Anaphylaxis: This is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. The patient presents with difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and low blood pressure, which are common symptoms of anaphylaxis. However, the patient does not report hives or swelling, which are also common symptoms of anaphylaxis.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis without further testing. The patient's symptoms are consistent with several respiratory conditions, and it is important to monitor her closely for any changes in her condition. The patient's history of otitis/bronquiolitis and the improvement with antibiotics and nebulization suggest that she may have a respiratory infection. However, the sudden onset of difficulty breathing and the need for adrenaline during nebulization suggest that she may also be experiencing an allergic reaction. Further testing, such as a chest X-ray or a skin test, may be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis."

Influenza: This is a viral infection that causes symptoms such as fever, cough, body aches, and fatigue. The patient presents with fever, body aches, and diarrhea, which is not a common symptom of influenza. However, the presence of a cough and the improvement of symptoms over the weekend before the worsening on Monday could suggest this diagnosis.

+2. Gastroenteritis: This is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, often caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The patient presents with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever, which are all common symptoms of gastroenteritis. The presence of a cough and improvement of symptoms over the weekend could also suggest this diagnosis, but it is not uncommon for gastroenteritis to present with respiratory symptoms.

+3. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV): This is a viral infection that primarily affects the respiratory system, causing symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. The patient presents with a cough, fever, and respiratory symptoms such as sibilant sounds and slight alargamiento espiratorio. The presence of diarrhea and improvement of symptoms over the weekend could also suggest this diagnosis, but it is more common for RSV to present with respiratory symptoms.

+4. Dengue Fever: This is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and rash. The patient does not present with a rash, which rules out this diagnosis. However, the presence of fever, body aches, and improvement of symptoms over the weekend could suggest this diagnosis, but it is unlikely as dengue fever is not common in areas where mosquitoes carrying the virus are not present.

+5. Typhoid Fever: This is a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella typhi, causing symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea or constipation. The patient presents with diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain, which are all common symptoms of typhoid fever. However, the absence of constipation and the presence of respiratory symptoms such as a cough and sibilant sounds could suggest an alternative diagnosis.

+6. Measles: This is a viral infection causing symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, and a rash. The patient does not present with a rash, which rules out this diagnosis. However, the presence of fever, cough, and diarrhea could suggest this diagnosis, but it is unlikely as measles is a rare diagnosis in fully vaccinated individuals.

+7. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease: This is a viral infection causing symptoms such as fever, mouth sores, and a rash on the hands and feet. The patient does not present with a rash on the hands and feet, which rules out this diagnosis. However, the presence of fever and mouth sores could suggest this diagnosis, but it is unlikely as this condition is more common in children under the age of 10.

While the patient does have disuria and hematuria, the absence of fever and other systemic symptoms such as chills, flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness argues against this diagnosis. However, the presence of pyuria and bacteriuria in the urine culture would be consistent with this diagnosis.

+3. Renal Stones: The patient's age and the presence of hematuria raise the possibility of renal stones. However, the absence of severe pain, nausea, and vomiting argues against this diagnosis. The normal creatinine level in the urine also makes this less likely.

+7. Renal Failure: The normal urinalysis results and the absence of other symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss, and edema argue against this diagnosis. However, the patient's age and the normal creatinine level in the urine make this a possibility. Further evaluation with blood tests and imaging studies would be necessary to rule out this diagnosis.

+8. Bladder Cancer: The presence of hematuria and the patient's age make bladder cancer a possibility. However, the absence of other symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency argues against this diagnosis.

+9. Anxiety: This is a mental health condition characterized by feelings of worry, fear, and apprehension. The patient does not present with any respiratory symptoms or signs of infection. +
+10. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): This is a condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and chest pain. The patient does not present with productive cough or fever. +

The patient presents with cough, fever, and chest pain, so bronchitis, pneumonia, pleurisy, and tuberculosis are potential diagnoses. The absence of significant diuresis or changes in temperature trend may argue against an acute exacerbation of COPD. The absence of chest auscultation findings suggestive of heart failure and the normal oxygen saturation argue against heart failure as a primary diagnosis. The absence of productive cough and greenish sputum may argue against asthma and bronchitis, but these conditions can present with atypical symptoms. The absence of significant risk factors for pulmonary embolism and the normal heart rate argue against this diagnosis. Anxiety and GERD are less likely given the respiratory symptoms. The patient's age, sex, and occupation suggest that tuberculosis and pneumonia are more likely diagnoses, but further evaluation is needed to confirm."

Osteoarthritis: This is a degenerative joint disease that affects the cartilage and bones, causing pain and inflammation. The patient's symptoms of pain in both muscles (proximal to quadriceps and adductor muscles, and supra-trochanteric area) align with this condition. However, osteoarthritis is typically not associated with equinoposis.

+2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): This condition involves the formation of blood clots in the deep veins, often in the legs. While the patient does not report any swelling or redness, the presence of pain in the muscles (especially in the supra-trochanteric area) could be a sign of DVT. However, the absence of other symptoms such as shortness of breath or calf swelling makes this diagnosis less likely.

+3. Muscle Strain: Given the patient's history of regular physical activity, muscle strain is a possibility. The symptoms of pain in the muscles, especially in the areas described, are consistent with this condition. However, the absence of acute injury or recent trauma makes this diagnosis less likely.

+4. Sciatica: This condition involves irritation or compression of the sciatic nerve, resulting in pain, numbness, or tingling in the legs. While the patient reports pain in both muscles, the absence of other symptoms such as numbness or tingling makes this diagnosis less likely.

+5. Referred Pain: Referred pain is when pain is felt in a location other than the actual source of the problem. Given the patient's symptoms, it is possible that the pain in the muscles is being referred from another source, such as the lower back or hips. Further investigation would be needed to confirm this diagnosis.

+6. Infection: An infection in the muscles or bones could be a possibility, given the patient's symptoms. However, the absence of fever or other signs of infection (such as redness or warmth) makes this diagnosis less likely.

+8. Tendinitis: Inflammation of the tendons could be a possibility, given the patient's symptoms. However, the absence of pain or tenderness directly over the tendon makes this diagnosis less likely.

+9. Nerve Compression: Compression of a nerve in the pelvis or hip could be a possibility, given the patient's symptoms. However, the absence of numbness or tingling makes this diagnosis less likely.

+10. Fracture: A fracture in the muscles or bones could be a possibility, given the patient's symptoms. However, the absence of any history of trauma makes this diagnosis less likely.

+11. Cancer: While rare, the presence of pain in the muscles could be a sign of cancer, such as bone cancer or soft tissue sarcoma. However, the absence of other symptoms such as weight loss or anemia makes this diagnosis less likely.

+12. Vasculitis: Inflammation of the blood vessels could be a possibility, given the patient's symptoms. However, the absence of other symptoms such as fever or rash makes this diagnosis less likely.

Tonsillitis: Fiebre, sore throat, and swollen tonsils. +3. Otitis Media: Fiebre, ear pain, and decreased hearing. +4. Sinusitis: Fiebre, nasal congestion, and facial pain. +5. Epiglottitis: Fiebre, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing. +6. Pneumonia: Fiebre, cough, and chest pain. +7. Scarlet Fever: Fiebre, rash, and sore throat. +8. Strep Throat: Fiebre, sore throat, and scarlatinal rash (absent in this case).

The patient presents with fever, nasal congestion, and a productive cough. They do not have a rash, difficulty swallowing, ear pain, chest pain, or decreased hearing. Therefore, scarlet fever, epiglottitis, otitis media, pneumonia, and strep throat can be ruled out. The remaining possibilities are influenza, tonsillitis, and sinusitis. The patient's age and specialty (pediatrics) suggest that influenza and tonsillitis are more likely diagnoses. However, without further information, it is impossible to make a definitive diagnosis based on the given symptoms alone. The patient's previous diagnosis of a viral upper respiratory infection also supports the possibility of influenza or tonsillitis."
