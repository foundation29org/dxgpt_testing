Trauma nasal: This is the initial diagnosis given in the emergency department. The patient's symptoms of nasal trauma, swelling, and local hematoma are consistent with this diagnosis. There is no evidence of bone deformities or crepitus, which suggests that the injury may be limited to the soft tissues of the nose.

+2. Fractura nasal: This is a potential diagnosis given the patient's history of nasal trauma. However, the absence of crepitus or bone deformities on examination and the radiograph showing no acute bone injuries makes this less likely.

+3. Hematoma subcutáneo: This could explain the swelling and hematoma noted in the patient's nasal and lower eyelid region. This condition occurs when blood collects in the subcutaneous tissues, often due to trauma.

+4. Contusión: This is a common result of blunt trauma, such as hitting a gym door. The patient's symptoms of swelling and hematoma are consistent with a contusion. However, the absence of other symptoms such as significant pain, discoloration, or difficulty breathing through the nose makes this less likely.

+5. Lesión de tejidos blandos: This is a broad diagnosis that could encompass the patient's symptoms of swelling and hematoma in the nasal region. The absence of bone deformities or crepitus on examination supports this diagnosis.

+6. Lesión ocular: Given the extension of the hematoma to the lower eyelid region, an eye injury could be a potential diagnosis. However, the patient does not report any visual disturbances, eye pain, or other eye-related symptoms, making this less likely. 

Remember, these are potential diagnoses based on the provided symptoms. Further diagnostic tests and a more detailed examination may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."

It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. The patient's symptoms of a catarrhal condition, cough, odynophagia (painful swallowing), myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain) are common in a cold. However, the patient does not have a fever or dyspnea (shortness of breath), which can sometimes occur with a cold.

+2. Influenza (Flu): This is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach ""flu"" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. The patient's symptoms of a catarrhal condition, cough, odynophagia, myalgia, and arthralgia are common in the flu. However, the patient does not have a fever, which is a common symptom of the flu.

The patient's symptoms of a catarrhal condition, cough, and odynophagia are common in pharyngitis. The patient's congested throat also indicates pharyngitis. However, the patient does not have a fever, which can sometimes occur with pharyngitis.

+4. Hypertension: This is a common condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. The patient's maximum blood pressure (TA Max) is 160.0, which is high and could indicate hypertension. However, the patient does not have any symptoms typically associated with hypertension, such as headaches, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds.

+5. Bronchitis: This is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. The patient's symptoms of a catarrhal condition and cough are common in bronchitis. However, the patient's chest X-ray does not show any condensations or effusions, which can occur with bronchitis."

Traumatic Injury: This is a physical injury of sudden onset and severity which requires immediate medical attention. The patient's symptoms of trauma to the upper extremities (MMSS), specifically a dislocation of the IFP of the 5th finger of the left hand, align with this diagnosis. The patient's age and gender are also common in cases of traumatic injury. However, the patient does not show symptoms of low oxygen saturation, abnormal heart rate, or abnormal blood pressure, which can sometimes accompany severe traumatic injuries.

+2. Finger Dislocation: This occurs when the bones of the finger are moved (dislocated) from their normal position. The patient's symptoms of a dislocated IFP in the 5th finger of the left hand following a contusion with a blunt object align with this diagnosis. The patient's age and gender are also common in cases of finger dislocation. However, the patient does not show symptoms of low oxygen saturation, abnormal heart rate, or abnormal blood pressure, which can sometimes accompany severe dislocations.

+3. Contusion: This is a type of injury, also known as a bruise, which can cause capillaries, or tiny blood vessels that can be found throughout the body, to break. The patient's symptoms of a contusion with a blunt object align with this diagnosis. The patient's age and gender are also common in cases of contusion. However, the patient does not show symptoms of low oxygen saturation, abnormal heart rate, or abnormal blood pressure, which can sometimes accompany severe contusions. 

+4. Fracture: This is a break, usually in a bone. If the broken bone punctures the skin, it is called an open or compound fracture. In the case of the patient, the X-ray showed no fracture, so this diagnosis is unlikely."

+2. Sprain: This is an injury to a ligament caused by tearing of the fibers of the ligament. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the first finger of the left hand are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the lack of information about any abnormal movement or force that could have caused such an injury makes this diagnosis less likely.

+3. Contusion: This is a bruise caused by a blow to the body that injures underlying tissues without breaking the skin. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the first finger of the left hand, as well as the reported contusion, are consistent with this diagnosis. 

+4. Tendonitis: This is inflammation or irritation of a tendon. The patient's symptoms of pain in the first finger of the left hand could be consistent with this diagnosis. However, there is no mention of repetitive movements or overuse of the hand, which are common causes of tendonitis.

+5. Arthritis: This is inflammation of one or more joints, causing pain and stiffness. The patient's symptom of pain in the first finger of the left hand could be consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's young age and lack of other symptoms such as joint redness or warmth make this diagnosis less likely."
