 Top 4: Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus (GEFS+) - GEFS+ is a spectrum of epilepsy syndromes where affected individuals usually have a history of febrile seizures that start in the first year of life and may progress to afebrile seizures. The probability of diagnosis is moderate, given the patient's history of prolonged or recurrent seizures triggered by fever or warmth, and the presence of SCN1A gene mutation, which is commonly associated with GEFS+.
 Top 5: Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI) - Also known as Dravet syndrome, SMEI is a severe form of epilepsy that begins in infancy. The probability of diagnosis is high, given the patient's early onset of seizures, developmental delays, and SCN1A gene mutation."
