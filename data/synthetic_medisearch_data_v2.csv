Disease,Detailed
Down syndrome,"The new patient presents with a number of non-specific complaints and findings. Notably, there are observable differences in physical features such as a flattened facial appearance, small ears, and eyes that slant upward. The patient also exhibits white spots on the iris of the eye. In terms of cognitive development, the patient has slower speech and a lower IQ compared to peers of the same age. The patient's growth seems to be lagging behind, with a noticeable shorter height. Additionally, the patient shows signs of health issues that include sleep apnea, recurrent ear infections, and possible visual and hearing impairments. It is also worth mentioning that the patient seems to have a higher susceptibility to infections, pointing to potential immune disorders. These findings require further investigation and diagnostic testing for a more definitive assessment."
Neural tube defect,"A new patient presenting in primary care might exhibit a combination of physical and neurological symptoms. Chief complaints may include issues with mobility, such as difficulty walking or paralysis of the legs. The patient might also report problems with incontinence of urine and feces. On physical examination, notable findings could include visible abnormalities such as an opening in the back or a sack of fluid outside the body on the spine. The patient may also show signs of anesthesia of the skin, and abnormalities of the hips, knees, and feet could also be observed. These symptoms and signs, while not conclusive, may be suggestive of a serious underlying condition that warrants further investigation."
Cleft lip/palate,"A new patient coming to primary care may present with a range of symptoms that suggest an undiagnosed condition. These might include difficulties with feeding or unexplained issues with speech development. The patient might also have a history of recurrent ear infections. Physically, a visible opening or split in the lip and roof of the mouth can be noted, which is typically present at birth. Some patients may also have a bifid uvula, a translucent zone in the soft palate, and a bony notch in the posterior edge of the hard palate. These findings, although not conclusive, would warrant further investigation."
Tumor of endocrine glands,"A new patient arriving at primary care could present with a variety of non-specific symptoms. These may include persistent headaches, unexplained vision loss, seizures, sudden weight gain, easy bruising, changes in mood such as increased irritability, anxiety, and depression, and alterations in sexual function. The patient may also experience high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar levels, irregular menstrual cycles, frequent urination, and muscle cramps. Furthermore, the patient might report incidents of chronic or recurrent hypoglycemias, often associated with neurological signs, as well as a history of recurrent nephrolithiasis. These assorted symptoms may not directly indicate a specific disease but could be consistent with the early stages of a disorder affecting the endocrine glands."
Cleft palate,"A new patient may present to primary care with certain signs and symptoms that are indicative of an underlying condition. The most common chief complaints would include difficulty in feeding, possibly leading to failure to thrive. The patient may also exhibit an abnormal-sounding, hypernasal speech. Notable findings in the oral cavity could consist of an unusual appearance, possibly a translucent zone in the soft palate, or a bony notch in the posterior edge of the hard palate. Some patients may also have conductive hearing loss, further complicating their condition. These symptoms can vary among patients, and a thorough examination is necessary for a definitive diagnosis."
"Renal agenesis, unilateral","A new patient coming to primary care might present with high blood pressure and urine tests could reveal proteins or blood. They might also exhibit signs of a poorly functioning kidney. In some cases, there could be associated congenital cardiac malformations and, in females, abnormalities in the müllerian structures might be found. Vesicoureteral reflux in the contralateral kidney could also be a notable finding."
Pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection,"The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms that include fever, a productive cough, and shortness of breath. There are also reports of chest discomfort, increased rate of respiration, episodes of sweating, and chills. Other general feelings of discomfort include headaches, muscular aches, and fatigue. In severe instances, confusion or delirium may be present, particularly in the elderly. For younger patients, symptoms may manifest as increased heart rate, low oxygen levels, irritability, decreased interest in feeding, congestion, and sleep disturbances."
"47,XYY syndrome","The patient presents with an above-average height and large head size. His physical examination reveals low muscle tone, wide-set eyes, and a curved finger. Additionally, the patient has an enlarged testicular size for his age. He has a history of asthma and seizures, coupled with noticeable tremors. On the behavioral front, the patient exhibits signs consistent with autistic spectrum disorder. Cognitive testing shows lower scores than his age-matched peers, particularly noticeable since his postnatal diagnosis. His constellation of symptoms and findings hint at a specific chromosomal condition."
Iniencephaly ,"A new patient presenting in primary care may have a notable physical appearance, with the head dramatically tilted backwards, along with significant changes in the vertebrae and skull. The skin of the face may seem continuous with the chest, and the skin of the posterior scalp with the back, giving the appearance of having no neck. Other findings may include an enlarged foramen magnum, irregular fusion of cervical vertebrae, and a small posterior fossa. The patient may also present with various other malformations. These notable findings, while not explicitly indicative of Iniencephaly, are consistent with the early stages of this condition."
Rare cutaneous lupus erythematosus,"The patient arrived at the primary care with a variety of concerns. The most notable was the appearance of coin-shaped skin rashes or lesions dispersed over various parts of the body, predominantly on the scalp, neck, hands, and feet. The individual also reported a heightened sensitivity to sunlight, which seemed to exacerbate the skin conditions. Distinctive discoid lesions were observed, characterized by thick, scaly patches that led to changes in skin color and potential scarring. Additionally, the patient reported hair loss, particularly in areas where the scalp was affected by the lesions. Complaints of recurrent mouth ulcers were also mentioned. These symptoms seemed to vary in severity and manifestation, suggesting a potentially complex and individualized progression of the patient's condition."
Congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens,"A new patient arriving at primary care may present with a primary complaint of difficulty conceiving with their partner, despite frequent unprotected intercourse. The patient may also report subtle signs of cystic fibrosis, such as mild respiratory or digestive issues, although these tend to be of mild intensity and the patient generally feels fit and healthy. It should be noted that these symptoms may not immediately raise suspicion of a serious underlying condition, as the patient may appear perfectly healthy otherwise."
Ovarian cancer,"The patient presents with a new and unusual feeling of bloating, fullness, and pressure in the abdomen. She also reports experiencing abdominal or lower back pain that is not associated with any known injury. She mentions a recent lack of energy that is affecting her daily activities. Other notable findings include increased frequency of urination, changes in her menstrual cycle, and discomfort during intercourse. She also finds difficulty in eating due to the sudden feeling of fullness. The symptoms have been persistent which led her to seek medical attention."
Primary Sjögren syndrome,"A new patient may present with an array of non-specific symptoms. They may report experiencing persistent dryness of the mouth and eyes, along with potential enlargement of the parotid glands. Complaints of general fatigue, muscular and joint pain might also be a part of their presentation. In some cases, they may describe symptoms consistent with neurological involvement, such as peripheral neuropathies and central nervous system conditions, although these are not always present concurrently. The patient's symptoms may vary greatly, and they may not yet have a clear diagnosis upon arrival."
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"A new patient presenting to primary care may report nonspecific symptoms such as persistent fatigue, weakness, unintentional weight loss, and chills. On physical examination, the provider might find painless swellings in the underarm or groin regions, which could be due to swollen lymph nodes. The patient may also describe a sensation of fullness or discomfort in the stomach, potentially indicative of splenomegaly. These symptoms and findings, while non-specific, could be consistent with a range of health conditions and warrant further investigation."
Congenital hydrocephalus,"A new patient may come into primary care displaying a variety of symptoms such as an unusually large head size for their age, a rapidly increasing head circumference, or a bulging soft spot on the top of their skull. Additionally, they may have eyes that seem to be fixed in a downward direction, experience seizures, and exhibit extreme fussiness or irritability. Other signs can include poor feeding habits, excessive sleepiness, vomiting, and decreased muscle tone and strength. They may also have developmental delays, such as trouble eating or delayed growth. It's important to note that these symptoms might not all be present simultaneously and can vary in severity from patient to patient."
Necrotizing enterocolitis,"A new patient with no clear diagnosis upon arrival could present with changes in their respiratory status which might necessitate increased respiratory support, decreased oxygenation, elevated respiratory rate, and increased PCO2. They might also exhibit abdominal distension, a duskiness, higher gastric residual, and an increased count of abdominal signs. In addition, there could be cardiorespiratory symptoms like alterations in heart rate and breathing patterns, which often precede gastrointestinal symptoms."
Preeclampsia,"The patient presents with a series of symptoms that are concerning. She has recently been experiencing new onset high blood pressure, which is a major red flag. Accompanying this, she has symptoms such as protein in her urine, persistent headaches, discomfort in the upper abdominal region, and noticeable swelling in her hands and face. She's also been struggling with sudden weight gain, bouts of nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath, and changes in her vision, including blurriness and seeing spots. She has also observed edema, a rapid increase in weight, pre-hypertension, and low protein levels in her blood. These symptoms are concerning and require further medical investigation."
Asherman syndrome,"A new patient presenting at primary care may express concerns about changes in her menstrual cycle, such as an absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) or unusually light or infrequent menstruation (hypomenorrhea). She may also report experiencing cyclic pelvic pain. Despite these changes in her menstrual cycle, some women may report that their menstrual flow and duration appear normal, but without the usual associated pain. An additional complaint may be difficulty conceiving or a history of recurrent spontaneous abortions."
Renal dysplasia,"The patient presents with a decreased appetite, exhibiting unusual thinness despite adequate food intake. There's no clear diagnosis at the time of arrival, but their medical history indicates the patient has been showing these symptoms from an early age. A prenatal ultrasound shows large, unusually bright kidneys which could be indicative of abnormal kidney development. Some cystic spaces are also seen in the kidneys, although this does not conclusively indicate a nonfunctional kidney."
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"A new patient presenting to primary care might report a rapidly growing mass or tumor, potentially alongside systemic symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, recurrent fevers, and night sweats. These symptoms might be coupled with unusual sensations such as chin numbness, particularly if the jawbone is affected. The individual might also have symptoms related to areas outside the lymph nodes, which can vary widely depending on the specific area impacted. Laboratory findings could reveal elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, signaling cell damage and potentially indicating a high burden of disease."
Trisomy X,"A new patient arriving in primary care could present a range of indicators consistent with an undiagnosed genetic condition. These may include physical abnormalities such as a smaller-than-average head, being taller than average with particularly long legs, and poor muscle tone, possibly resulting in delayed motor skills development and increased clumsiness. The patient might also exhibit speech and language delays or have a history of learning difficulties, particularly in reading. Behavioral or emotional concerns, including heightened anxiety, less-developed social skills, or symptoms consistent with ADHD, may also be noted. Additionally, any history of kidney problems, seizures, or heart problems could be relevant."
Scleroderma,"A new patient may present with complaints of unusual sensitivity to cold in their fingers or toes, a condition often accompanied by puffiness in these areas. As the condition progresses, they may also experience hardening and thickening of the skin, and in some cases, a curling inward of the fingers. They may also report changes in the skin's texture and appearance, along with swelling and pain. In addition to these skin-related symptoms, the patient may express concerns about problems with their blood vessels, muscles, heart, digestive system, lungs, or kidneys. A notable physical finding could be the change in the contour of their fingerpads, particularly on the ring fingers, where the usually peaked contour is replaced with a hemisphere-like fingertip contour."
Non-immune hydrops fetalis,"A new patient arriving at primary care may present with several indications that could be consistent with a certain condition. The pregnant patient could report an excess of amniotic fluid and an ultrasound may reveal a thick or abnormally large placenta. Further examination of the fetus may present additional findings such as an enlarged spleen, heart, or liver and fluid surrounding the heart or lungs. Severe swelling, especially in the abdominal region of the fetus, could also be observed."
Renal cell carcinoma,"A patient may come in with a variety of non-specific complaints and findings. These could include noticing a change in the color of their urine, potentially due to the presence of blood, which has turned pink, brownish, or red. They may also have detected a lump in their abdomen. In addition, they may report unexplained weight loss and a diminished appetite. Generalized feelings of fatigue could also be a key complaint, possibly tied to anemia. It's important to remember that these symptoms can also be indicative of other conditions, and further investigations may be necessary to establish a clear diagnosis."
Genetic peripheral neuropathy,"A new patient may present to primary care with a variety of symptoms. They may report difficulties with balance, such as stumbling, tripping, or having trouble running or walking. They might also describe unusual sensations in their limbs, such as reduced ability to feel pain, heat, or cold, or they may experience nerve pain, tingling, or prickling sensations, often beginning in the feet and progressing upward. Physical examination could reveal reduced or absent reflexes, changes in foot shape like high arches or hammer toes, muscle loss in the lower legs, or skeletal changes such as scoliosis. In some cases, they might report issues with their autonomic system, such as constipation, difficulty sweating, dizziness, dry eyes or mouth, incontinence, sexual dysfunction, or skin discoloration. These symptoms could have appeared in early adolescence, or even as early as infancy."
Cardiogenic shock,"The new patient presents with a constellation of symptoms, none of which point definitively to a single diagnosis. Despite appearing generally unwell, the patient cannot pinpoint a specific complaint. They report feeling lightheaded and confused, with an accompanying sense of unease and anxiety. Physical examination reveals a rapid but weak pulse, irregular heartbeat, and quick, shallow breathing. The patient's skin is cool and moist to touch. Their pupils are markedly dilated. They mention a persistent, unexplained chest discomfort and a recent decrease in urine output. They also report increased thirst and a persistently dry mouth. The patient's blood sugar is noted to be lower than expected. These symptoms are concerning and warrant immediate further investigation."
Acute sensorineural hearing loss by acute acoustic trauma or sudden deafness or surgery induced acoustic trauma,"A new patient could present to primary care complaining of a sudden or gradually developing decrease in hearing ability, such as sounds becoming muffled or faint. They may report difficulty in hearing normal speech, possibly perceiving it as a whisper. Moreover, the patient might have a history of exposure to loud noises or recent surgery. It's important to note that a significant reduction in hearing might not present until a considerable proportion of the auditory structures in the cochlea are damaged."
AL amyloidosis,"A new patient presenting with no clear diagnosis may provide a myriad of complaints and findings consistent with a systemic condition. They may report muscle weakness or increased signs of muscle lesions, potentially even mixed hyperlipoproteinemia. Physical examination may reveal particular signs such as an unusually enlarged tongue or purple patches around the eyes. The patient might also mention symptoms suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome. Complaints related to organ dysfunction might be present, such as elevated blood pressure potentially indicating kidney issues, or shortness of breath hinting at heart complications. It's important to consider that these symptoms can be nonspecific and may vary according to the specific organs involved."
Hepatitis delta,"A new patient presenting to primary care may have an unclear diagnosis upon arrival, but symptoms and findings such as persistent fatigue, fever, joint pain, and stomach discomfort may be observed. Additionally, the patient may report feelings of nausea, loss of appetite, and changes in the color of their urine and stool. Notably, they may exhibit a yellowing of the skin and eyes, a condition known as jaundice."
Fetal cytomegalovirus syndrome,"A new patient presenting to primary care without a clear diagnosis may express a combination of ambiguous symptoms and findings. They might be of low birth weight and exhibit signs such as jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes. Further examination may reveal hepatosplenomegaly, an enlarged liver and spleen. A skin rash could be present, along with petechiae, which are small red or purple spots on the skin. The patient may have a smaller than average head size (microcephaly). In some cases, there may be inflammation in the eye (chorioretinitis). However, it's important to note that these symptoms might not always be present in every case."
Romano-Ward syndrome,"The chief complaints of a patient that would be consistent with the early stages of a condition similar to Romano-Ward syndrome might include episodes of fainting particularly during physical exercise or periods of stress, which are not related to epileptic fits but are due to cardiac arrhythmias. Notable findings could include a prolongation of the QT interval on an EKG, indicating a predisposition to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The patient may also report symptoms such as dizziness and slower heart rates, particularly if they are a newborn or child up to 3 years old. However, it should be noted that these symptoms may not be present in all patients, and some may remain symptom-free for years."
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,"The patient presents with chief complaints that include a persistent ache or discomfort in the abdomen and lower back. They have noticed an increase in the frequency of their urination, sometimes accompanied by blood, raising concerns. The patient also reports an unexplained rise in blood pressure readings from recent health checks. Despite these symptoms, the patient does not have a history of kidney diseases or any clear diagnosis explaining these manifestations."
Congenital pulmonary valvar stenosis,"The patient presents with a general feeling of fatigue, expressing difficulty in performing tasks requiring physical exertion. They also complain of shortness of breath, particularly noticeable during physical activity. Upon clinical examination, an unusual heart sound, suggestive of a heart murmur, is discernible during auscultation. The indications are varied among different patients and these symptoms do not necessarily confirm a particular diagnosis, but they warrant further investigation."
Uveitis,"A new primary care patient may present with chief complaints of blurry vision, floaters, and distortion of central vision. Upon further examination, the practitioner might note mild to moderate anterior chamber inflammation and thin keratic precipitates in the inferior portion of the cornea. Additional findings could include vitreitis, vasculitis in the peripheral retina, intravitreal ""snowballs,"" retinal ""snowbanking,"" optic neuritis and cystoid macular edema. These symptoms and findings can form a pattern which may indicate an underlying inflammatory ocular condition, necessitating further investigation and potential referral to an ophthalmologist."
Congenital hypothyroidism,"The patient, a newborn, presents after a prolonged gestation and is notably larger at birth than expected. The posterior fontanel is significantly large, and the infant experiences respiratory distress, hypothermia, and peripheral cyanosis. The parents report decreased activity, increased sleep, and poor feeding behaviors. The onset of stooling was delayed, and the baby has a distended abdomen and has experienced episodes of vomiting. The baby has also had protracted icterus and some edema. Additionally, the baby has had persistent jaundice and constipation."
Moderate and severe traumatic brain injury,"The patient arrives at the primary care facility with no clear diagnosis. The individual presents with a loss of consciousness, disorientation, and functional impairment. There are also physical symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, and changes in coordination, balance, appetite, sleep, vision, and hearing. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms are also notable, including fatigue, anxiety, depression, irritability, and problems with memory, concentration, and decision-making."
22q11.2 deletion syndrome,"The patient presents with a variety of complaints that are yet to be diagnosed. These include developmental delays, unexplained seizures, and unilateral weakness. There is also evidence of neuroanatomical abnormalities, such as persistent cavum septi pellucidi and/or cavum vergae, aberrant cortical veins, polymicrogyria or cortical dysplasia, inner ear deformities, hypoplastic internal carotid artery, and a smaller than usual cerebellum. The patient also exhibits symptoms often associated with psychosis, decreased verbal IQ scores, and reduced adaptive social skills. Gastrointestinal issues such as abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, and chronic constipation are also prevalent. The patient has also shown signs of negative/disorganized subthreshold syndrome and parkinsonian motor signs."
Primary congenital hypothyroidism,"A new patient arriving at primary care may present a variety of nonspecific complaints and findings. They may report struggling with constipation and have a history of poor feeding. During the physical examination, they might exhibit an unusually low body temperature and a distinctive, hoarse cry. Noticeable physical characteristics could include a large tongue (macroglossia), decreased activity levels (hypoactivity), dry or mottled skin, abdominal distension, and a shorter stature than average for their age group. The patient's face might appear puffy, and there might be an umbilical hernia present. Signs of jaundice could also be evident."
Follicular lymphoma,"In the early stages, a new patient coming to primary care may present with chief complaints of persistent fatigue and recurrent episodes of night sweats or chills that can't be attributed to a known cause. The patient may also report unexplained weight loss and a persistent itchiness without any visible skin problems. Notable findings during clinical examination could include the presence of a fever. It's pertinent to note that the patient may not have any clear symptoms or findings, making early detection often challenging."
Hemorrhagic fever-renal syndrome,"The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms that are non-specific yet concerning. These include fever, general discomfort, a loss of appetite, and signs of renal insufficiency. The patient also complains of flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, and lower back pain. On examination, the patient's eyes appear noticeably red. Laboratory tests reveal low serum albumin levels, acute kidney injury, increased vascular permeability, and coagulation abnormalities. The patient's condition seems to be worsening over time with multiple organ systems, particularly the liver and kidneys, showing signs of potential failure. Furthermore, there are indications of hemorrhagic complications."
Non-papillary transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder,"A new patient arriving at a primary care clinic may present with macroscopic hematuria, which is visible blood in the urine. This is a common early sign of a potential bladder issue. Further diagnostic procedures such as a cystoscopy may be undertaken, which allows for inspection of the bladder lining. If any abnormalities are found, a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) may be performed for definitive diagnosis and treatment."
High-grade dysplasia in patients with Barrett esophagus,"A new patient arriving at a primary care clinic may present with a range of symptoms, including frequent heartburn, chest pain, difficulty swallowing, and episodes of vomiting blood or dark, coffee-ground-like material. The individual could also be passing black, tarry, or bloody stools. If these symptoms are present, it would be essential to perform further diagnostic tests. One key finding that could be revealed by such tests is the presence of abnormal cells which could potentially become cancerous. This would be determined through an examination of tissue samples obtained during an endoscopy."
Aorta coarctation,"A new patient arriving at a primary care facility may present a set of unclear symptoms and findings. They may complain of significant chest discomfort and fatigue and may have difficulties with breathing. Upon further examination, the healthcare provider may identify a cardiac murmur, a notable systolic blood pressure gradient between the arms and legs, and decreased lower-extremity pulses. Hypertension in the upper extremities may also be observed. These symptoms and findings could be indicative of a potentially serious, yet unidentified, congenital condition."
Uremic pruritus,"A new patient arrives for primary care with no clear diagnosis, presenting with chief complaints of daily or near-daily itching, especially bothersome during nighttime. The affected areas are large and discontinuous, but symmetric. The severity of this pruritus varies, being mild in some instances and severe in others. It is also notable that these symptoms do not follow a clear pathogenic mechanism and can vary from individual to individual."
Radiation proctitis,"The patient presents with rectal bleeding, which appears to be their chief complaint. They also mention changes in bowel habits, such as more frequent urges to use the bathroom and watery diarrhea. They've noticed some mucous discharge from their rectum and have been experiencing rectal pain. They also report symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramping. They have also noticed some weight loss. The patient mentioned that these symptoms started a few months ago, with no other clear cause or diagnosis upon their arrival at primary care."
Osteochondritis dissecans,"The patient presents with a vague history of joint pain that has progressively worsened. The discomfort is particularly noticeable after periods of high-impact activities or prolonged use of the affected joint. Accompanying the pain, there might be experiences of swelling and tenderness in the same area. The patient may also report unusual sensations such as a locking or catching feeling when straightening the limb, or even feelings of instability during standing or walking. The physical examination might reveal a decreased range of motion in the impacted joint. Further diagnostic imaging could indicate abnormalities such as potential separation of bone and cartilage or presence of loose fragments."
Isolated anencephaly/exencephaly,"A new patient may present with a set of complaints that indicate a potential neurological disorder, such as developmental delays or abnormalities in physical growth. They may also express concerns about unusual findings from prenatal screenings or ultrasounds, which might indicate potential issues with the formation of the brain and skull. It's important to note that these symptoms and findings would need to be corroborated with further diagnostic tests to confirm any suspicions."
Eosinophilic esophagitis,"A patient arrives in primary care without a clear diagnosis, presenting with complaints that vary depending on age. Infants and young children might exhibit feeding problems, frequent vomiting, and abdominal pain. Adolescents and adults, on the other hand, might report difficulty swallowing and instances of food becoming lodged in the throat. Both children and adults may experience persistent heartburn, resistant to common treatments. These symptoms collectively suggest a possible underlying condition worth further investigation."
Tetralogy of Fallot,"The patient presented with a set of notable findings and complaints. Prenatal imaging showed a large aortic root, a small pulmonary artery, stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract, and a ventricular septal defect. There was also evidence of an overriding aorta and right ventricular hypertrophy, with additional findings of hydrops fetalis and polyhydramnios. Upon arrival, the patient exhibited cyanosis, reported shortness of breath, and was observed squatting after exertion. A physical examination also revealed a brisk, short, rasping systolic murmur."
Neurofibromatosis type 1,"A patient may arrive at a primary care facility showing a variety of signs and symptoms. They may have several light brown skin spots, known as café-au-lait macules, as well as benign skin tumors. Freckling may be observed in the armpits or groin area. The patient could also exhibit an unusually large head size, or macrocephaly. Behavioral and cognitive indications such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities, and cognitive impairment may also be present. There might be instances of vision problems due to benign brain tumors affecting the optic nerve, and benign growths on the iris of the eye. They may also have some skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis, tibial pseudarthrosis, and orbital dysplasia. The presence and severity of these symptoms can vary widely among individuals."
Permanent congenital hypothyroidism,"The patient might present with a range of symptoms including increased lethargy and sleep, troubles during feeding, constipation, and prolonged jaundice. In terms of physical examination, the patient might have unusual facial features, larger than normal fontanels, an enlarged tongue, a distended abdomen with an umbilical hernia, and decreased muscle tone. These symptoms and signs may not be very pronounced and can be easily missed if not specifically looked for."
Congenital toxoplasmosis,"A new patient presenting to primary care could exhibit a variety of symptoms and signs. The patient might display signs of cerebral ventricular dilatation, which could potentially be bilateral and symmetrical, and may have rapidly progressed over a short period of time. Other noticeable findings could include intracranial and intrahepatic densities, increased thickness and hyperdensity of the placenta, ascites, and in rare cases, pericardial and pleural effusions. There might be evidence of delayed neuropsychomotor development. More severe clinical signs could include hydrocephalus, eye disease, or intracranial calcifications. However, it's important to note that the patient may not exhibit all of these symptoms and could potentially be asymptomatic."
Placental insufficiency,"The patient may present with concerns about the baby being smaller than expected for the gestational age, or not growing at the expected rate. They may also express worry about a decrease in fetal movement. In addition to these complaints, clinicians may observe abnormal results from tests, such as a Doppler ultrasound, which could indicate problems with blood flow in the umbilical artery. It's important to note, however, that these signs can be subtle and may not be noticed without regular prenatal care."
Fragile X syndrome,"A new patient might present to primary care with a combination of cognitive, social, and physical symptoms. Cognitive challenges might include learning disabilities, noticeable in academic or daily functioning. Concurrently, the patient may exhibit social and emotional difficulties, potentially characterized by aggressive behavior in boys or pronounced shyness in girls. Language and speech issues, particularly in boys, might also be a concern. On physical examination, the patient may have some subtle distinctive features such as a slightly elongated face, prominent ears, and in post-pubertal males, enlarged testicles. It's important to note that these symptoms can vary widely in severity and might not always be present, especially if the underlying genetic alteration is small."
Spinal cord injury,"A patient presenting to primary care without a clear diagnosis may express various complaints and display certain findings that could indicate an underlying neurological issue. Altered mental state or changes in consciousness levels may be reported, along with potential intoxication. The patient may exhibit certain neurological symptoms or signs that cause concern, and they could be suffering from a severe and distracting pain, possibly originating from the chest or a long bone fracture. Furthermore, they may report midline spinal pain or tenderness. Other findings could include severe respiratory compromise and hypotonia in neonates. In some cases, the patient may exhibit signs of spasticity, including spasms, particularly if these symptoms have been developing over the past month."
Sepsis in premature infants,"A new patient, a premature infant, presents to primary care with no clear diagnosis. The chief complaints and notable findings include increased need for respiratory support, prolonged capillary refill, and greyish skin tone. The infant has a central venous catheter in place. Additionally, the infant exhibits episodes of apnea or bradycardia, desaturations, and increased gastric residuals. There are also signs of decreased alertness and activity, difficulty tolerating feedings, poor muscle tone, difficulty in maintaining body temperature, and pale or spotted skin color. There have been instances where the infant's heart rate slows down or the baby stops breathing for brief periods."
Vernal keratoconjunctivitis,"The new patient in question presents with a chief complaint of intense eye itching, along with a heightened sensitivity to light. The patient has also been experiencing a burning sensation in the eyes accompanied by an increase in tear production. Furthermore, the individual has reported a feeling reminiscent of a foreign body in the eye, accompanied by discomfort. Upon examination, notable findings include giant papillae, superficial keratitis, and an observable redness of the eye, indicating possible conjunctival hyperaemia."
Transposition of the great arteries,"The patient, a newborn, presents with a noticeably blue or cyanotic skin tone, particularly evident during episodes of crying or agitation. This bluish discoloration might have been initially overlooked, however, it has become increasingly noticeable over the first month of life. Additionally, the patient shows signs that could be indicative of congestive heart failure, although no clear diagnosis has been made upon arrival at primary care."
Retinitis pigmentosa,"The patient may present with complaints of difficulties seeing in low light conditions, specifically experiencing night blindness. They may also report a gradual reduction in their peripheral vision, akin to seeing through a tunnel. Other notable findings could include altered color perception and changes in their visual field. Some individuals may also have experienced instances of light flashes or headaches. These symptoms can vary widely among individuals and their progression can be either slow or rapid."
Polycythemia vera,"A patient arriving at a primary care facility, with no clear diagnosis, might report a variety of complaints that could suggest an underlying hematologic issue. These complaints may include fatigue, unexplained itching, trouble breathing when lying down, difficulty with concentration, and unintended weight loss. The patient may also describe a sensation of early satiety after eating, alongside occasional bouts of abdominal pain. Visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision, could be present, as well as episodes of dizziness and generalized weakness. The patient might also note excessive perspiration, even in cool conditions, and a propensity to bruise or bleed easily."
Peripartum cardiomyopathy,"A new patient presents to primary care with fatigue and shortness of breath. She reports swelling in her ankles, feet, and legs, and has been urinating more frequently at night. These symptoms have been increasingly bothersome over the past few weeks. Additionally, she has had an unusual incidence of thromboembolism. On examination, an echocardiogram reveals a decreased ejection fraction of less than 45%, and a fractional shortening of less than 30%. Her left ventricular end-diastolic dimension is greater than 2.7 cm/m2 of her body surface area."
Soft tissue sarcoma,"A new patient might arrive at primary care with chief complaints of a painless lump or mass under the skin, typically noticed on an arm or leg. As the mass grows and exerts pressure on nearby organs, nerves, blood vessels, and muscles, the patient may start experiencing pain and difficulty in breathing. If the mass is in the abdomen, the patient might report abdominal pain and vomiting, and may have observed bloody or black stools. However, these findings are not exclusive to a particular condition and could be indicative of a range of other medical conditions as well."
Idiopathic hypersomnia,"A new patient arrives at the primary care facility presenting with a marked increase in daytime sleepiness that is not alleviated by restful sleep at night. The patient reports a persistent need to sleep during the day, often succumbing to long naps that do not provide the expected rejuvenation. Despite getting what should be sufficient sleep at night, the patient struggles with waking up and often feels disoriented and excessively groggy upon arousal. This pattern has been persistent for at least the past three months."
Primary systemic amyloidosis,"A new patient might report a diverse array of symptoms that seem unrelated at first glance. These could include unexplained heart failure, enlarged liver, and kidney damage manifesting as heavy proteinuria. They might also report nerve damage symptoms, such as weakness, numbness and tingling in fingers and toes, and burning sensations in the feet. Breathing difficulty, skin changes like bruising, purple patches around eyes, thickened skin, hair loss, and gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and constipation could also be part of the patient's complaints. Clinically, heart disease might be evident, and some patients may demonstrate signs of restrictive cardiopathy."
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,"A new patient coming to primary care may present with several symptoms that warrant further investigation. Notably, they may be experiencing respiratory distress, manifested as rapid or difficult breathing, and possibly a bluish coloration of the skin, indicating a lack of oxygen. In addition to these, the patient may also exhibit a sunken or hollow appearance of the abdomen, known as a scaphoid abdomen. Auscultation may reveal decreased breath sounds on one side of the chest. In some instances, the patient may present with non-specific gastrointestinal complaints. It is important to note that these symptoms can vary widely, and some may not be apparent until later in life."
Partial atrioventricular septal defect,"A new patient may come into primary care presenting with complaints of difficulty breathing and excessive sweating, particularly during physical activity. The patient might also report frequent fatigue and unexplained weight loss or failure to gain weight appropriately for their age. Upon examination, the patient might have signs of frequent lung infections. While these symptoms can be associated with a range of conditions, they could be indicative of a heart defect. However, it's also important to consider the patient's overall health and any potential genetic conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms."
Non-acquired combined pituitary hormone deficiency,"A patient presenting in the early stages of this condition may show signs of growth failure and a lack of muscle development. Their voice may not deepen as expected and their body hair may grow sparsely. For males, they may present with impaired growth of the penis and testes, while females may not have begun menstruation or show signs of breast tissue development. These symptoms can be quite general and having one or a few of them does not necessarily indicate the presence of this specific condition."
Central retinal vein occlusion,"A new patient arriving at primary care might report experiencing a decrease in vision or blurred vision in one eye, without an apparent cause. Upon examination, clinicians might observe retinal hemorrhages, dilation of retinal veins, and cotton wool spots, which are areas of retinal ischemia. The patient's eye might also exhibit a relative afferent pupillary defect, a condition where the pupils respond abnormally to light. It should be noted that the varying combination of these symptoms and findings could hint at the severity of the underlying condition."
Dermatitis herpetiformis,"A patient may present with an intense itching and burning sensation that is highly discomforting. On examination, one may find erythematous papules and urticarial plaques on the skin. It is not unusual to observe grouped vesicles or small blisters, often concentrated on extensor surfaces such as the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Furthermore, signs of excoriations may be evident, a result of the patient scratching the itchy lesions. It should be noted that the characteristic vesicles might not always be visible, as they can be obscured or destroyed by the excoriation."
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease,"A new patient presenting to primary care could have a variety of nonspecific complaints that might be consistent with the early stages of a lymphoproliferative disorder following a transplant. They might report feeling generally unwell, with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, unintentional weight loss, and night sweats. They may also mention swelling in their neck or other parts of the body, which could be due to enlarged lymph glands or organs such as the spleen or liver. Medical examination could reveal jaundice, elevated white blood cell counts, anemia, or abnormal bleeding or bruising. More severe symptoms could include bone pain, rashes, frequent infections, headaches, seizures, confusion, and symptoms associated with nausea and vomiting. A key point is that symptoms may vary depending on where lymphoid masses are located, and unfortunately, early detection can be a challenge because the disorder often presents in a nonspecific way."
Glial tumor,"The patient presents with a combination of non-specific yet persistent symptoms, which have been progressively worsening. Chief complaints include unexplained and persistent headaches, often worse in the morning or during physical activity and episodes suggestive of seizures. There have been noticeable changes in personality, coupled with occasional blurred vision and hearing loss. The patient also reports difficulty with speech, changes in cognitive function, and mood swings. Other notable findings include persistent nausea and vomiting, unusual drowsiness, muscle weakness, and a significant loss of appetite. These symptoms have persisted for several months without a clear diagnosis."
Cytomegalovirus disease in patients with impaired cell mediated immunity deemed at risk,"A new patient with no clear diagnosis upon arrival may present with a constellation of nonspecific symptoms. These could include a persisting fever, significant fatigue, a sore throat, and general muscle aches. These symptoms might be accompanied by a history of impaired cell-mediated immunity and increased susceptibility to infections. As the condition progresses, the patient might demonstrate evidence of organ involvement, which could manifest in a myriad of ways depending on the organ system affected. As always, these symptoms should be interpreted in the context of the patient's overall health status and medical history."
Thyroid hemiagenesis,"A new patient arriving at primary care may present a variety of non-specific symptoms. They may not have any noticeable complaints relevant to their thyroid, as these cases are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. However, they may exhibit signs related to other thyroid conditions, if present, such as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or nodular goiter. These could include fatigue, sensitivity to cold or heat, weight changes, and enlarged thyroid gland. These findings would call for further investigations to determine the exact underlying cause."
Syndactyly type 1,"A new patient arriving in primary care may present with certain physical abnormalities involving their fingers or toes. Their chief complaints could revolve around a noticeable webbing or joining of these digits, with severity varying from a slight connection to a complete fusion. In rare instances, the patient may even show signs of their fingers or toes being connected by bone. While these findings are significant, it's essential to consider that they could also be indicative of a larger syndromic condition."
Bullous pemphigoid,"A new patient in primary care, without a clear diagnosis, may present with a variety of non-specific symptoms. The primary complaints are likely to revolve around itchy, red skin and the presence of hives-like plaques. As the condition progresses, the patient may observe the formation of large, tense blisters on the skin. If there's a mucosal involvement, the patient might also report symptoms like mouth sores or bleeding. Note that these symptoms are often mistaken for other conditions, potentially leading to a delay in the correct diagnosis."
Alopecia universalis,"A new patient has come to primary care with a unique set of complaints and findings. They have noticed a complete loss of hair, not just from their scalp, but from their entire body including eyebrows, eyelashes, and even from inside their nose. They've also reported an uncomfortable feeling in the areas where the hair loss has occurred, describing it as a sort of itching or burning sensation. Despite these symptoms, the patient does not exhibit signs of atopic dermatitis or nail pitting commonly associated with other similar conditions."
Immune thrombocytopenia,"A patient presents to primary care without a clear diagnosis. They report a recent history of easy bruising, characterized by purple bruises on their skin and inside their mouth. In addition, they've noticed pinpoint-sized red or purple dots on their skin. They also have been experiencing an unusual amount of bleeding: frequent nosebleeds that are not due to dryness or injury, gum bleeding during routine dental hygiene practices, and in the case of menstruating individuals, heavier than usual menstrual bleeding. These signs and symptoms, collectively, may suggest an underlying issue with the patient's platelets or blood clotting process."
Narcolepsy type 1,"A new patient arrives in primary care with chief complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness, which began during their adolescence. This symptom was initially overlooked, attributed to hormonal shifts and disordered sleep habits common in that age group. The patient reports experiencing low quality, fragmented sleep and occasional uncontrollable urges to fall asleep, even in the most unlikely situations. Additionally, they report episodes of sudden loss of muscle control, usually following periods of intense emotion. These symptoms, while not yet definitively diagnosed, point towards a particular condition that requires further investigation."
Primary biliary cholangitis,"A new patient coming to primary care may report general feelings of fatigue and a persistent itchiness across the body. They may also describe discomfort in the upper abdominal region. However, it should be noted that there might be a lack of clear symptoms in some cases. The manifestation and intensity of these symptoms can differ significantly from person to person."
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease/Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy,"A new patient may present to primary care with complaints of frequent clumsiness, stumbling, or tripping, and may have difficulty with tasks like walking or running. They may also report frequent falls. The patient may also describe feelings of weakness in their arms or legs, possibly alongside reduced reflexes. The patient may have a distinctive high stepping gait when walking and may report weakness in their hands. Other issues may include stiffened joints, muscle pain or cramping, problems with balance, loss of sensation, unusual fatigue, or nerve pain. They might have issues with their feet, like unusual arching or toe deformation, and may show signs of muscle loss in the lower legs. Some patients may even display curvature of the spine. These symptoms often occur symmetrically, affecting both sides of the body."
Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome,"A new patient presenting in primary care may describe a variety of complaints that could be consistent with the early stages of a condition increasing the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. These may include the recent discovery of a lump in the breast or underarm, thickening or swelling of part of the breast, and changes in the size, shape, or appearance of the breast. Additionally, they may report abdominal bloating, pressure, and pain, feeling abnormally full after eating, having difficulty eating, and an increase in urination or an increased urge to urinate. They would likely have no clear diagnosis upon arrival."
Neovascular glaucoma,"A new patient who has not yet been diagnosed may present with chief complaints of decreased visual acuity and eye pain. The eye examination may show high intraocular pressure and abnormal blood vessels on the iris surface, which is known as rubeosis iridis. There may also be signs of retinal ischemia and severe vaso-occlusive retinopathy. In some instances, these ocular findings may be associated with systemic symptoms that might suggest an underlying systemic disease. It's also important to note that the patient might not have any significant symptoms, as glaucoma can often be asymptomatic in the early stages, usually detected during routine eye examinations."
Craniosynostosis,"The patient arrives with concerns about their child’s unusual head shape and the presence of a noticeable bulge at the top of the skull. Additionally, the parents express worry over their child's irritability and delayed development, particularly in gross motor skills. There are also comments about possible visual disturbances the child might be experiencing. Upon physical examination, impressions are noted on the child's skull. These findings are somewhat atypical, and further investigations are recommended to understand the cause of these symptoms."
Esophageal atresia,"A new patient may present with issues related to swallowing, and it may be observed that they have an unusual amount of drool or mucus. They may also exhibit breathing difficulties, with symptoms ranging from coughing and choking to more serious manifestations such as bluish skin tone indicating low oxygen levels. Breathing might be labored and nostrils may be flared. Another peculiar observation could be a high-pitched, catlike cry. Notably, there may be instances of gagging and the presence of white, frothy bubbles in the mouth."
Congenitally uncorrected transposition of the great arteries,"A new patient presenting to primary care may exhibit a bluish coloration of the skin, indicative of cyanosis, due to a low oxygen level, typically presenting within the first month of life. This condition requires a patent ductus arteriosus and a ventricular septal defect allowing for the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, without which the condition is not compatible with life. It's important to note that these symptoms may not always be present, as the condition can often be asymptomatic."
Non-syndromic anorectal malformation,"A new patient arriving at primary care may present with a number of abnormalities that could suggest an underlying issue. These may include the absence of an anal opening, or an anal opening that is not located in the typical position, possibly being too close to the vagina. The patient may also have experienced issues with defecation, such as not passing stool within the first 24 to 48 hours of life, or passing stool from an abnormal location such as the urethra, vagina, scrotum, or the base of the penis. Other notable findings may include a swollen abdomen, or the presence of an abnormal connection, or fistula, between the rectum and the reproductive system or urinary tract."
Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,"A patient arrives with persistent skin irregularities, presenting as rashes or scaly patches that may resemble common conditions like eczema or psoriasis. The individual may also complain about skin redness or irritation. On physical examination, notably, there are red to brown, or purple lesions, or alternatively, white, light brown, or tan spots. Some areas of the skin might also show scaly or shiny patches. These manifestations primarily occur on parts of the body that are usually not exposed to the sun, such as the back, belly, chest, buttocks, or upper thighs."
Autoimmune hepatitis,"A patient may come in for a primary care visit presenting with non-specific complaints such as feeling unusually tired. Notably, there may be visible yellowing of the skin and eyes. Lab tests might reveal unexplained elevated liver enzymes. Some patients may not display any overt symptoms early on, complicating the clinical picture and making it challenging to arrive at a clear initial diagnosis."
Multicystic dysplastic kidney,"A new patient might arrive at primary care with no clear diagnosis. The individual could present with non-specific complaints such as discomfort in the abdominal region. On examination, there might be a palpable mass in the abdomen and the patient might also exhibit high blood pressure readings. However, it's important to note that these are not exclusive findings and could be associated with a range of other conditions. The patient may otherwise appear healthy, as this condition is often asymptomatic in its early stages."
Unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney,"A new patient might present with a constellation of non-specific complaints, which could include recurrent urinary tract infections, severe abdominal pain, and a history of hypertension. These symptoms might be accompanied by no clear etiology upon initial presentation. The patient could also present with a history of prenatal ultrasound anomalies, although this might not always be the case. It's crucial to note that these symptoms are not exclusive, and they could indicate a variety of different conditions."
Scarring in glaucoma filtration surgical procedures,"A new patient coming to primary care may present with complaints of vision changes, which could be an indication of increased intraocular pressure, a complication related to scarring from previous glaucoma filtration surgical procedures. They may also report issues related to the use of antiproliferative agents if they have been exposed to them during surgery. However, it is important to note that there may not be explicit symptoms the patient can identify related to the scarring process. Regular monitoring by healthcare providers is essential to identify potential complications early and manage them effectively."
Pulmonary fungal infections in patients deemed at risk,"In a new patient coming to primary care without a clear diagnosis, chief complaints might include non-specific symptoms such as fever, persistent cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. These could be accompanied by fatigue and unintentional weight loss. The patient may also have a history of being in environments that pose a risk for fungal infections or have a pre-existing condition that compromises the immune system. This could include chronic lung conditions like cystic fibrosis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or tuberculosis. Being immunocompromised, due to reasons such as organ transplantation, undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, or taking immunosuppressive drugs, also puts patients at risk. Recent acute viral infections like the flu or SARS-Cov-2 infection could also be a notable finding in the patient's history."
Pouchitis,"A new patient arriving in primary care may present with frequent bowel movements, a sense of urgency, a feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, incontinence, nocturnal seepage, rectal bleeding, abdominal cramps, and pelvic discomfort. Diagnosis would consider these symptoms along with potential endoscopic and histological signs of inflammation. It's crucial to acknowledge that these symptoms and findings could stem from a variety of inflammatory and functional pouch disorders."
Congenital hypothyroidism due to developmental anomaly,"In the early stages, a new patient coming to primary care might present with general sluggishness, sleeping more than usual, difficulties with feeding, and constipation. Prolonged jaundice may persist, and characteristic physical features may be noted such as a puffy face, enlarged fontanels, an unusually large tongue, a distended abdomen with an umbilical hernia, and decreased muscle tone. However, these symptoms can be subtle and may not be present at birth, thus raising the importance of early detection via newborn screening."
Partial chromosome Y deletion,"A new patient presenting to primary care might complain of issues related to fertility, such as difficulty in conceiving a child. Notable findings may be minimal as Partial chromosome Y deletion often does not present with distinct early symptoms. However, any complaints or history related to male infertility could be considered a notable finding in this context. Remember, these symptoms don't immediately point towards Partial chromosome Y deletion, but they are consistent with the early stages of this condition."
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"A new patient, under the age of 16, presents with complaints of persistent joint pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. Notably, the patient may also exhibit symptoms like warmth and swelling in the joints, occasional limping, and redness in the affected area. Accompanying these complaints, the patient may also have swollen lymph nodes and recurrent fevers. In some instances, there may be a rash and the involvement of one or more joints, and even the eyes. These symptoms have been present for more than six months. It's also worth noting that these complaints could potentially indicate a systemic issue."
Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"A new patient presenting at primary care could be in the early stages of a certain type of juvenile arthritis if they report persistent joint pain, stiffness, and a reduced range of motion, particularly in the knees and ankles. Physical examination may reveal warm and swollen joints, possibly accompanied by redness. The patient may also display a limp. Furthermore, additional findings that could support this suspicion include the presence of swollen lymph nodes and a history of recurrent fevers. It is crucial to consider that these symptoms should have been present for more than six months. If not promptly and appropriately managed, this condition may lead to severe outcomes such as cartilage loss or erosive disease."
Non-syndromic posterior hypospadias,"The patient presents with concerns related to abnormal urination, specifically spraying or difficulty in directing the urine stream. On examination, there is an observed abnormality in the location of the urethral opening, which is displaced from its usual location at the tip of the penis and is found somewhere along the underside of the penis. The patient also has a partial development of the foreskin, which creates a hooded appearance on the upper side of the penis. There might also be a curvature of the penis, more evident during erection. These findings could suggest a urogenital deformity of a congenital nature."
AIDS wasting syndrome,"A new patient arriving at primary care may present with a combination of unexplained weight loss and severe muscle wasting. They may also complain of persistent night sweats and a productive cough which doesn't seem to improve over time. They may further report chronic diarrhea lasting for more than a month, accompanied by a fever. These symptoms target lean body mass rather than fat. These complaints and findings, while potentially indicative of a range of health issues, could suggest a serious underlying condition requiring further investigation."
Acute liver failure,"The patient came in with complaints of persistent discomfort on the upper right side of his abdomen, accompanied by an unusual tiredness and a significant drop in weight without any changes in his diet or physical activity. Upon examination, there was noticeable yellowing of the skin and eyes and the patient seemed to be slightly confused. Furthermore, the blood work revealed some abnormalities in his coagulation profile. Although a clear diagnosis was not immediately apparent, these symptoms and findings could indicate an early stage of a severe liver condition."
Sarcoidosis,"The patient presents with a range of symptoms that, while disparate, suggest an underlying systemic issue. They report experiencing common cold-like symptoms alongside a persistent cough and shortness of breath, which has been causing them some distress. They also note a significant degree of fatigue and malaise, with unexplained weight loss, that has been ongoing for several weeks. Upon examination, there is evidence of lymphadenopathy. The patient also describes recurring eye inflammation, and skin lesions are observed. There is a report of occasional hoarseness, cough, swallowing difficulties, and breathlessness. No clear diagnosis has been made at this time."
Infant acute respiratory distress syndrome,"A new patient arrives at the primary care clinic, presenting with no clear diagnosis. The infant demonstrates a respiratory rate of over 60 breaths per minute and exhibits both grunting noises and nasal flaring when breathing. Additionally, the infant has retractions, where the chest muscles pull inward during inhalation, indicative of difficulty in breathing. The skin displays a bluish color, suggesting a lack of adequate oxygen, and the baby is struggling to feed and generally lethargic."
Proximal spinal muscular atrophy,"Upon arrival, the patient presents with chief complaints of difficulty in performing basic motor movements such as crawling, sitting up, and controlling head movements. They also report issues with walking and have been experiencing progressive worsening of these symptoms. In addition, the patient has been having trouble with swallowing and breathing. The severity of these symptoms appears to vary with time."
Tenosynovial giant cell tumor,"A new patient arrives at primary care, presenting with non-specific complaints largely centered around one or more joints. The patient experiences discomfort, which is characterized by pain and swelling of the affected joint. The patient also reports a reduced range of motion, joint instability, and stiffness. Additionally, the patient may notice an increase in warmth over the affected joint area and may describe a sensation of locking, popping, or catching sounds when moving the joint. These symptoms, while they may seem insidious, are causing the patient significant discomfort and are affecting their daily activities."
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency,"A new patient in primary care might present with a range of symptoms. For infants, issues such as neonatal cholestasis and potential development of cirrhosis by the age of two might be observed. Other symptoms could include recurrent bronchitis with wheezing, a persistent cough, severe pneumonia, urinary tract infections, pronounced eczema, and congenital malformations. For adults, symptoms could mimic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with cough, sputum expectoration, and progressive dyspnea. Liver-related issues such as cholestatic hepatitis in the neonatal period and chronic liver disease leading to cirrhosis in adults may also be notable findings."
Myasthenia gravis,"The patient presents with chief complaints of muscle weakness, particularly around the eyes. Symptoms include drooping eyelids, blurry or double vision, and issues with eye and eyelid movement. Additionally, there might be observable control issues with facial muscles, leading to changes in facial expressions, and difficulties with chewing. Communication difficulties might be present due to throat muscle involvement, including a hoarse voice and difficulties speaking or swallowing. Notable physical findings can include neck weakness, fatigue, and weakness in fingers, hands, arms, and legs. The patient may also report problems with walking up stairs or lifting objects."
Marfan syndrome,"The patient presents with a variety of complaints and observations that appear to be interrelated. Skeletal abnormalities are prominent, with features such as a high arched palate, arachnodactyly, characterized by unusually long, slender fingers and toes, and flatfoot. Cardiovascular concerns are also noted, including symptoms that may suggest an aortic aneurysm. The patient also reports ocular difficulties, which, upon examination, could be related to a displaced lens. Other complaints include a heart murmur potentially indicative of mitral valve prolapse, suspected aortic root dilatation seen on imaging, and episodes of dyspnea. All these findings point towards an underlying connective tissue disorder."
Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency,"A new patient arrives in primary care with no clear diagnosis. The chief complaints and notable findings include recurring instances of watery diarrhea, persistent abdominal pain, and bloating. These symptoms appear to intensify after the consumption of specific food items, particularly those high in sucrose and starches such as fruit."
Proximal 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome,"The patient presents with a variety of symptoms that remain unexplained by a clear diagnosis. Notably, there are signs of developmental delay, especially in speech. Unusual physical characteristics include a flat facial profile, low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, a high-arched palate, and a hypotonic face. The patient also has long, thin fingers and a sacral dimple. In addition, there are reports of feeding difficulties and a history of recurrent ear infections. On a behavioral level, there are instances of hyperactivity, a short attention span, and difficulty concentrating. The constellation of these symptoms and findings are suggestive of a potential genetic condition."
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy,"A new patient may present to primary care with chief complaints of recurring palpitations and episodes of fainting or syncope, with palpitations being particularly prevalent. Upon examination and testing, there may be significant ECG changes such as a prolongation of QRS duration beyond 110 ms in leads V1 to V3, the sudden appearance of an epsilon wave, and an inversion of the T wave. Additionally, there may be a noticeable dilation of the right ventricle. These findings could suggest a cardiac condition that requires further diagnostic evaluation."
Limbal stem cell deficiency,"A new patient presenting in primary care may report experiencing persistent sensitivity to light and repeated incidents of ocular surface breakdown, which despite treatment, persist. The patient may also exhibit overt signs of conjunctivalisation of the cornea. Further examination may reveal other ocular conditions with abnormalities of ocular surface repair, such as severe scarring following burns, radiation keratopathy, and drug toxicity among others. It is important to note that these symptoms and findings may be indicative of a range of ocular conditions, and further investigation would be necessary to pinpoint the exact cause."
Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia,"A new patient may present with a variety of nonspecific symptoms. She might mention experiencing discomfort in the vulvar region, which could be described as itching or pain. This discomfort might be exacerbated during sexual intercourse. Upon clinical examination, there may be visible skin changes, such as raised bumps, flat spots, or discoloration, with the colors varying from white, gray, red, brown, or black. These patches may also have a different texture from the surrounding skin. It's important to note that some patients may not report any explicit symptoms, making clinical examination crucial in these cases."
Complete atrioventricular septal defect,"The patient presents to primary care with chief complaints of difficulty feeding, rapid breathing, and an unusual level of fatigue. Notably, despite sufficient nutritional intake, the patient is not gaining weight or growing at the expected rate, a condition known as failure to thrive. Physical examination reveals signs consistent with congestive heart failure, such as tachycardia, and there may be signs of right ventricular pressure overload. Further examination may show signs of pulmonary hypertension. These findings indicate a possible underlying cardiovascular condition that requires further investigation."
Brugada syndrome,"The patient may come in with a history of fainting episodes, seizures, or abnormal breathing during sleep, suggestive of a possible cardiac arrhythmia. The patient may also report instances of sudden, unexplained death in the family, especially at a young age. The physical exam may not reveal anything out of the ordinary, and the patient may appear to be in good health. However, these symptoms and history taken together may point to an underlying, potentially serious cardiac condition."
Cystic fibrosis,"A new patient presenting in a primary care setting may have a range of complaints and findings that require further investigation. These may include a history of prolonged jaundice, difficulty passing the first stool (meconium), recurrent lung infections, frequent coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. The patient might also exhibit a unique characteristic of having a salty-tasting skin when kissed. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as greasy, unpleasant smelling stools that are either loose or constipated could also be present. Notably, there might be concerns regarding poor weight gain and delayed growth despite adequate nutrition. In some cases, severe anemia can also be the first sign. This constellation of symptoms may be associated with a spectrum of conditions and further diagnostic tests are recommended for a definitive diagnosis."
Isolated spina bifida,"The patient may present with a primary complaint of persistent back pain, which may extend to the back of the legs. They may also report leg weakness and occasional numbness in the same region. Other complaints could include issues with bladder or bowel control. The patient may also have noticed an abnormal curvature of the spine, or scoliosis. In terms of physical findings, the primary care provider might note a discolored patch, a hairy patch, an indent or dimple, or a growth or pad of fat along the lower back. The patient's legs and feet may appear misshapen. These symptoms could indicate a spinal cord abnormality."
Isolated biliary atresia,"The patient, a newborn, presents with persistent jaicundice, noticeable by yellowing of the skin and eyes. There is also a change in the color of body waste, with stools being pale and urine dark. These symptoms have been persistent since the first few weeks of life. No other major signs, such as failure to thrive, splenomegaly, or ascites, which are typical of advanced liver disease, are apparent at this time."
Anal fistula,"A new patient might present with persistent discomfort in the anal region, experiencing a variety of pain types including dull, sharp, throbbing, or aching. This pain could be accompanied by constipation and rectal discharge or bleeding. The patient may also notice swelling or tenderness of the skin surrounding the anus, and possibly a palpable, tender nodule or lump. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and chills could indicate an underlying issue. Additionally, the patient might report urinary difficulties, such as trouble initiating urination."
Adenovirus infection in immunocompromised patients,"The patient presents with a high fever and systemic complaints that include general malaise, severe fatigue, and night sweats. They also report gastrointestinal disturbances and respiratory issues, including persistent coughing and unusually rapid breathing. Additionally, recent blood work has indicated elevated levels of certain hepatic enzymes. These symptoms suggest an infection, but further testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and pinpoint the exact cause."
Non-infectious posterior uveitis,"A new patient may present to primary care with complaints of discomfort in one eye, which might include eye pain and sensitivity to light. They may also report visual disturbances, such as blurred or cloudy vision, and the presence of dark spots in their vision, referred to as floaters. The patient might show signs of redness in the front of the eye, and their vision may be decreased. These symptoms could have appeared suddenly and severely, or they may have developed gradually and worsened over a period of weeks. It is also possible that both eyes are affected, although the condition typically starts in one eye."
Pemphigus vulgaris,"A new patient may present with widespread blisters affecting the oral mucosa, which are often the first manifestations of the condition. These oral lesions could be the sole initial presentation, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis. On the skin, the patient may have flaccid blisters that rapidly turn into erosions and lead to crust formation. In some instances, the patient may have lesions in the umbilical area."
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,"A newborn infant may initially appear healthy, but as the arterial duct closes, the infant may experience a decrease in systemic perfusion, leading to low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxemia), acid buildup in the body (acidosis), and shock. The liver may be enlarged due to congestive heart failure. While a heart murmur may not always be present, a non-specific heart murmur could be detected. Additionally, the second heart sound might be loud and single due to aortic atresia."
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1,"The patient presents with a history of frequent stumbling, tripping, and difficulty with balance that have led to frequent falls. These symptoms have been worsening over time. They also report fatigue, clumsiness, and difficulty with tasks requiring fine motor skills. Upon physical examination, there are reduced or absent reflexes, evidence of muscle weakness in the arms and legs, and a specific type of gait characterized by high stepping. Further examination reveals signs of muscle atrophy, stiff joints, and foot deformities such as high arches or hammer toes. There may also be indications of nerve pain, and in some cases, hearing loss. The patient's symptoms occur symmetrically on both sides of the body. Notably, the patient also has a family history of similar symptoms, suggesting a possible genetic component."
Familial isolated dilated cardiomyopathy,"A new patient presenting at primary care could complain of experiencing shortness of breath and fatigue, despite no strenuous activities or evident cause. They might also report swelling in their ankles, legs, feet, and abdomen, as well as visible distension of veins in their neck. Despite these symptoms, some patients may report feeling relatively normal, with these symptoms being the only indicators of a possible underlying condition. Furthermore, upon examination, the physician might note heart abnormalities like an increased heart size or diminished heart strength, potentially indicating a progressive weakening or failure of the heart muscle. It's particularly noteworthy if the patient has a family history of similar heart issues."
Gastroschisis,"A new patient presenting to primary care without a clear diagnosis could potentially express concerns related to malnutrition, such as poor weight gain or failure to thrive, due to compromised absorption of nutrients. They may complain about gastrointestinal issues such as vomiting, constipation, or a visibly swollen abdomen, which might be stemming from intestinal dysfunction. In more severe cases, the patient might present with severe abdominal pain, fever, and a rapid heart rate, indicating potential life-threatening infections due to tissue death in the intestines."
Trisomy 18,"A new patient arriving at primary care might present lower-than-average birth weight and low muscle tone, along with distinctive facial features such as a smaller head, wide-set eyes, a small lower jaw, and possibly a cleft lip or palate. Physical anomalies may also include a webbed neck, clenched fist or overlapping fingers, feet with a rounded bottom (termed 'rocker-bottom' feet), crossed legs, and a shortened breastbone. In terms of health issues, the patient may struggle with feeding or sucking, resulting in difficulty gaining weight. Congenital heart issues might be present. Other potential concerns could range from undescended testicles in males, to eye or vision issues, hearing loss, seizures and gastrointestinal issues."
Recessive X-linked ichthyosis,"The patient arrives with generalized skin dryness and scaling, which is quite severe. The scales, predominantly on the trunk and extensor surfaces of the limbs, are dark brown and polygonal in shape. There are also slight scaling and small skin fissures. Being male, he presents some extracutaneous manifestations such as corneal opacities and undescended testes. Despite his young age, he exhibits some neurodevelopmental and psychiatric traits. There are signs suggestive of cardiac arrhythmias, and rare fibrotic and bleeding-related conditions."
Acute peripheral arterial occlusion,"A new patient may arrive at a primary care facility presenting with a sudden onset of unexplained limb pain. They might also complain of other sensations such as coldness or numbness in the affected limb, and potentially some degree of muscle weakness. Upon examination, the health professional might find the limb to be unusually cold to the touch, or observe a pale or bluish discoloration. A weak or even absent pulse in the affected limb could also be a notable finding. If these symptoms and signs are not promptly addressed, they could escalate to more serious complications."
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia,"A new patient presenting to primary care may report recurrent nosebleeds, a symptom which typically starts around age 12. They may also exhibit small, abnormal blood vessel formations or telangiectases on the lips, tongue, oral mucosa, face, and fingers. These symptoms often develop later than the nosebleeds, sometimes not until later in childhood. In rare instances, the patient may experience complications such as stroke and hemorrhage due to larger abnormal blood vessel formations in the lungs, liver, or brain."
Primary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,"The patient may present with subtle symptoms such as fatigue and poor appetite, along with more noticeable signs like swelling in the hands, feet, or face, and changes in urination patterns such as foamy urine and increased frequency, particularly at night. There may also be reports of unexplained weight gain. Clinically, findings may point towards conditions such as high cholesterol and blood pressure levels, and presence of blood in urine. More severe signs could be related to kidney impairment, but these are typically observed as the condition progresses."
Buerger disease,"The patient presents with episodic pain and coldness in the fingers, which seem to occur intermittently. These symptoms may be an early indication of a specific vascular condition. As the symptoms progress, the patient may experience more severe manifestations such as the development of skin ulcers, or even gangrene, which in severe cases, may necessitate amputation. These findings could be related to a particular vascular disorder characterized by inflammation and thrombosis in small and medium-sized blood vessels, typically in the hands and feet. It's crucial to monitor these symptoms closely as they can progressively worsen over time."
Tuberculosis,"A new patient presenting to primary care may complain of persistent feelings of fatigue and malaise, along with a low-grade fever. As the condition progresses, the patient may experience an increase in fever, confusion, nausea and vomiting, lethargy, and irritability. In some instances, they may even lose consciousness. If the patient is a child, the primary symptoms could be a cough and low-grade fever. However, it's important to note, especially in the case of school-age children who have been in close contact with someone who has a pulmonary condition, that they may not show any symptoms or physical findings, despite potentially having a moderate to severe condition."
Herpes simplex virus stromal keratitis,"The patient presents with a variety of symptoms including eye redness, discomfort, excessive tearing, and an increased sensitivity to light. Upon examination, there is noticeable inflammation within the cornea and signs of opacification. These findings could potentially lead to vision impairment or even blindness if left unaddressed. Laboratory testing of tears or corneal epithelium scrapings may be required to identify the cause."
Microtia,"A new patient arrives in primary care with chief complaints related to their ears. They note that one or both of their external ears appear small, underdeveloped, or even absent, which is a condition that has been present since birth. These physical abnormalities are not accompanied by any hearing loss or pain, but the patient may express concerns about their appearance. Additionally, the patient may present with other facial abnormalities or conditions, possibly indicating a broader spectrum of congenital issues."
Rare carcinoma of pancreas,"The new patient presents with a cluster of nonspecific symptoms that, while common to various conditions, warrant further investigation. The individual has been experiencing abdominal or back pain, which can be indicative of an internal mass pressing on nerves or other organs. Additionally, they have unintentionally lost weight, which may be due to a decrease in appetite or metabolic changes. The patient also exhibits signs of jaundice, as evidenced by a noticeable yellowing of the skin and eyes, suggesting a potential obstruction in the bile duct. Digestive issues such as nausea, vomiting, and pain related to eating have been also reported, as well as recent diagnosis of diabetes. It's noteworthy that the patient, who had presented with no clear diagnosis, raised concerns about these escalating and interconnected symptoms."
Systemic sclerosis,"A new patient may present with a combination of symptoms that include sensitivity to cold or stress that manifests as color changes (white, blue, then red) in fingers and toes, commonly referred to as Raynaud's phenomenon. The patient may also have noticeably swollen digits. Additionally, lab results may reveal the presence of specific antibodies (anticentromere and antitopoisomerase-I). A capillaroscopy may also show an abnormal pattern, consistent with a certain autoimmune condition. These findings, while not specific to any single condition, may suggest a systemic issue with an autoimmune component."
Hepatocellular carcinoma,"A patient presenting in primary care with no clear diagnosis may have a variety of nonspecific complaints and findings. They may report feeling nauseous, having a decreased appetite, and experiencing unintended weight loss. Fatigue could also be a concern, which could progress to extreme sleepiness. Physical examination may reveal signs of jaundice, such as yellowing of the skin, eyes, or mucus membranes. The patient might also show signs of ascites, which is an accumulation of fluid in the belly leading to swelling in the abdomen and legs. They may have a tendency to bruise easily or bleed. Lastly, the patient may have pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. It is crucial to remember that these symptoms and findings can be associated with a variety of conditions, and further diagnostic investigations would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis."
Mucopolysaccharidosis type 4A,"A new patient coming to primary care without a clear diagnosis may present a variety of complaints. They may report experiencing recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and have visible inguinal or abdominal hernias.

The patient may also demonstrate a delay in growth and development, poor school performance, or behavioral problems if they are a child. Notable findings on physical examination may include the absence of a palpable thyroid gland in its usual anatomical position in the neck. However, these symptoms and findings could be indicative of a range of conditions. Further diagnostic tests, including imaging techniques and thyroid function tests, would be required to confirm a diagnosis."
Progressive supranuclear palsy,"A new patient could present with complaints of recurrent unexplained falls due to postural instability. They may also report difficulties with vision, particularly in directing the gaze downward. Cognitive changes may be noticeable, with potential signs of dementia, particularly of the frontal type. Other signs could include movement disorders, such as symmetric parkinsonism and freezing of gait. Speech and swallowing difficulties, presenting as dysarthria and/or dysphagia, may also be raised as concerns. These symptoms can vary among patients and some may not present all of them."
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,"A new patient presents to primary care with a chief complaint of persistent headaches. These headaches are often described as dull aching pain that seems to worsen over time. The patient also reports experiencing transient visual disturbances, where vision seems to darken or ""gray out"" temporarily, particularly in one eye. Accompanying these symptoms, the patient mentions episodes of pulsatile tinnitus, where they hear a rhythmic pulsing in their ears. Nausea and dizziness are also expressed by the patient. These aforementioned symptoms and findings have been persistent and have progressively worsened over the past few weeks."
Cystinuria,"A new patient might present with recurrent episodes of back or abdominal pain, possibly accompanied by frequent urination and blood in the urine. They could also have a history of urinary tract infections. It's notable that some individuals may not show any overt symptoms until they develop a kidney stone. The severity and frequency of these symptoms can vary widely among different individuals."
Chronic primary adrenal insufficiency,"The patient presents with a variety of non-specific complaints that have been ongoing for a while. The individual appears chronically fatigued and exhibits muscle weakness, accompanied by a noticeable loss of appetite leading to unintended weight loss. Further, complaints of abdominal discomfort, irregular digestion marked by episodes of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, and frequent irritability are apparent. The patient also discloses irregularity or absence of menstrual periods, along with a decreased sex drive. Interestingly, the individual has developed a craving for salty foods and has been experiencing episodes of lightheadedness on standing up. Along with these complaints, a noteworthy observation is an unusual skin darkening, particularly at the elbows, knees, lips, and skin folds, as well as in scars. Laboratory test results also indicate an imbalance in the patient's electrolytes, with lower sodium and higher potassium levels in the blood."
Holoprosencephaly,"In a new patient presenting to primary care without a clear diagnosis, the chief complaints and notable findings could include developmental delay and feeding difficulties. The patient might also have distinct facial features that may manifest as unusual eye placement or a single central tooth. In more severe cases, the patient might exhibit features like a cleft lip/palate. Additional medical symptoms may also be present such as seizures, instability of temperature, heart rate and respiration, and potential signs of endocrine disorders. It's important to note that these features can occur in isolation, without cerebral malformations, and are then referred to as microforms."
Supravalvular aortic stenosis,"A new patient might present to primary care with a chief complaint of increasing fatigue and shortness of breath, particularly during exercise. They might also describe episodes of chest discomfort or even fainting, especially associated with physical exertion. The patient could note a sensation of a racing or fluttering heart and difficulties sleeping. Physical examination may reveal a heart murmur suggestive of aortic valve dysfunction. Symptoms like these can often go unnoticed or be dismissed by the patient until they start significantly affecting their daily routine and physical activity."
Hirschsprung disease,"A new patient presenting to primary care may express primary complaints of severe constipation or difficulties with bowel movements. The patient may also show signs of poor feeding and poor weight gain, which could be suggestive of nutritional challenges. Progressive abdominal distention may also be present, indicating possible intestinal obstruction problems.

Additionally, the patient may have been experiencing symptoms related to the central nervous system, including recurring headaches, nausea, vomiting, confusion, loss of muscle control, and in severe cases, even seizures. Musculoskeletal pain, such as a limp, joint pain or back pain, could also be among the issues the patient is facing."
Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome,"The patient, a young woman, presents with primary amenorrhea, having never begun menstruation by age 16 which is the main cause of her concern. Despite this, the patient shows typical secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development and pubic hair, indicating normal ovarian function. Her karyotype is a normal female one (46,XX) and she has normal external genitalia. However, there may be signs of an absent or underdeveloped uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina, which could be discovered upon further investigation."
Williams syndrome,"The new patient presents with a mix of developmental, physical, and behavioral abnormalities. They exhibit a noticeable delay in developmental milestones, with signs of intellectual disability. Personality-wise, their demeanor is uniquely distinctive. They are also experiencing cardiovascular and connective tissue irregularities. Growth deficiency and endocrine abnormalities are also present. On the physical side, they have distinctive facial features, hypotonia, hyperextensible joints, and have had trouble with feeding leading to poor weight gain. Their medical history includes low birth weight, failure to thrive, unsuccessful breastfeeding attempts, and gastroesophageal reflux. Pediatric signs such as developmental delay and nocturnal irritability were observed in their infancy."
Alopecia totalis,"A new patient with no clear diagnosis upon arrival may complain of noticing small patches of hair loss on their scalp, which might initially be dismissed as normal shedding or breakage. The hair loss, which is often in the form of small, round, and seemingly random bald patches, is typically the first and most prominent symptom they might report. There may not be any other significant symptoms accompanying this hair loss in early stages. The absence of other symptoms, coupled with the mild and easily overlooked nature of the initial hair loss, can make early-stage Alopecia totalis a challenge to diagnose at a routine primary care visit."
Mastocytosis,"A new patient, upon arrival, may present with a variety of symptoms. They could have skin lesions and describe feelings of intense itching or sudden flushing. The patient might also report instances of what appears to be anaphylaxis. In addition, they could complain about recurring gastrointestinal issues, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and symptoms similar to reflux disease.

These are the main complaints and notable findings that could be seen in this patient."
Nephroblastoma,"A new patient presenting to primary care may report experiencing constipation, abdominal discomfort, and persistent feelings of nausea and vomiting. They might also feel generally weak and fatigued, with a noticeable decrease in their appetite. Their caregiver might have observed a fever that does not seem to be linked to a common infection. More alarming signs could include the presence of blood in their urine or noticeable discoloration of urine. An uncommonly high blood pressure might also be detected, which could manifest in the form of chest pain, shortness of breath, and headaches. On physical examination, an uneven growth on one side of the body may be found, as well as possible abdominal swelling."
Familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine,"The patient comes in with a history of experiencing auras that affect their vision, along with heightened sensitivity to light and sound. They have also reported difficulty with speech, a degree of confusion, and sensations of numbness and tingling. These episodes are often accompanied by fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting. Following these symptoms, the patient describes a period of weakness affecting one side of the body. The patient also complains of severe, throbbing or pounding headaches that are mainly localized to one side of the head. These symptoms have been occurring periodically and are of increasing concern to the patient."
Acute myeloid leukemia,"The patient presents with a number of non-specific symptoms that could be associated with a variety of conditions. They report feeling excessively fatigued and weak, and have experienced unintentional weight loss. They also mention feeling dizzy and lightheaded at times. They have noticed that their skin seems paler than normal and that they have been feeling cold. They have also been experiencing frequent nosebleeds and have noticed red or purple spots on their skin. Additionally, they have been suffering from frequent infections and have had a persistent fever and night sweats. They also report shortness of breath and headaches."
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome,"The patient may present with a history of initial normal development followed by sudden onset of extreme irritability, recurring fevers without a clear source of infection, loss of previously acquired skills, and slowing of head growth. Physical examination may reveal abnormal neurological findings, an enlarged liver and spleen, and reduced platelet count. Laboratory tests may show elevated liver enzymes. Over time, the patient may also develop skin lesions on the fingers, toes, and ears that resemble chilblains. Neuroimaging may show specific abnormalities."
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,"The new patient presents with several unclear symptoms that merit further investigation. In particular, they exhibit signs of androgen action that are premature given their age, including the presence of pubic/axillary hair, adult body odor, oily skin or hair, comedones, acne, and accelerated growth. Females in this situation may present with hirsutism and irregular menses, while males may have disorders of sex development. Additionally, the patient is experiencing hypertension and hypokalemia, which are usually not common in their age group."
Dysbetalipoproteinemia,"A new patient arriving at primary care may present with no clear symptoms. However, they may have a history of high cholesterol levels or a familial history of heart disease, indicating an elevated risk for cardiovascular disorders. A blood test may reveal unusually high cholesterol, even in the absence of a clear diagnosis. While there may not be overt signs of disease, the patient may experience non-specific symptoms like mild chest discomfort or shortness of breath, which could be indicative of compromised blood flow due to potential arterial plaque buildup. These findings hint at an underlying lipid disorder that needs further investigation."
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,"A patient arriving at primary care without a clear diagnosis may present with episodic syncope, particularly precipitated by exercise or acute emotional stress. They may also report symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, and presyncope. These symptoms could have started at any age, but typically onset would be between ages seven to twelve years. The patient's medical history may not reveal any significant findings, as these symptoms can progress to severe outcomes such as sudden cardiac death, emphasizing the need for prompt and thorough evaluation."
Septo-optic dysplasia spectrum,"A new patient presenting to primary care might report noticeable visual impairments and developmental delays. Physical examination could reveal signs of endocrine dysfunctions, such as short stature or early onset of puberty. The patient's history might also include episodes of seizures and sleep disturbances. Furthermore, upon interaction and observation, the healthcare provider might note neurodevelopmental impairments, including intellectual disability or developmental delay, and behaviors resembling those seen in autism."
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans,"The patient would likely present with a firm, slowly growing plaque that they may describe as a ""rubbery lump"". The lesion, situated predominately on the trunk, may have been observed to change color and enlarge over time. It may present as an exophytic lesion that is ulcerated or a depressed skin area. The affected area is typically painless and could exhibit a pink or violet hue."
Duane retraction syndrome,"A new patient in primary care might present with noticeable issues in eye movement, such as difficulty moving their eyes horizontally, or their eyes retracting backward when trying to move them towards the nose. Common symptoms could include the narrowing of the eye opening, as well as abnormal vertical movements of the eye. The patient might also have an inward or outward turning of the eye, or a straight alignment of the eyes. Other observations might include an abnormal head position, possibly as a compensatory mechanism for eye movement difficulties, and signs of amblyopia, or 'lazy eye'. The manifestation of these symptoms can vary greatly based on individual circumstances."
Sickle cell anemia,"A new patient may present with complaints of fatigue and episodes of pain that are not attributable to any clear cause. They may also experience problems with their respiratory system, delayed growth and development compared to their peers, and an increased frequency of infections. In children under two years, swelling and inflammation of the hands and feet, known as dactylitis, may be noticed. Additionally, there may be instances of sudden, severe drops in hemoglobin levels due to the spleen trapping a large amount of blood, a condition known as acute splenic sequestration."
Polymalformative genetic syndrome with increased risk of developing cancer,"A new patient coming to primary care might present with various ambiguous symptoms. They might have benign growths that could potentially become cancerous over time, most commonly found in the colon, and these could increase with age. The patient may also show symptoms of fibromas, desmoid tumors, or sebaceous cysts, which are fluid-filled growths under the skin, as well as eye lesions on the retina. In some cases, the patient might demonstrate signs of a growth disorder that causes overgrowth, with increased height and weight starting from birth. An increased risk of developing tumors in certain parts of the body, like the liver or kidneys, could also be a notable finding. However, the exact symptoms can vary greatly depending on individual genetic variations."
Aplasia cutis congenita,"A new patient presents with localized or widespread absence of skin, primarily on the scalp, but potentially elsewhere on the body. Scarring may be observed on these areas. Other symptoms include a hair collar sign, vascular stains, and nodules, which could hint at underlying skull or cerebrovascular involvement. The patient may also have other congenital defects and malformations, or limb anomalies and congenital heart defects. A family history of similar symptoms could also be present. It's important to conduct a thorough examination and consider a comprehensive medical history to get a clearer picture of the patient's condition."
Duchenne muscular dystrophy,"The patient, a young child, is notably delayed in reaching certain developmental milestones, such as walking well by 18 months, sitting or standing without assistance, and lifting their head while lying on their stomach. There is a clear impairment in their motor development, with particular difficulty in walking. The child's leg muscles are unusually large for their age. A unique behavior is observed when they attempt to stand from a seated or prone position - they start on their hands and knees and then slowly walk their hands up the shins, knees, and thighs until standing. Their gait is characterized by a noticeable waddle, likely due to weakness in the hips and upper thigh muscles. Furthermore, the child has been slow to develop speech and language skills, starting to speak much later than their peers."
Dravet syndrome,"The patient, within their first year, may present with seizures that are typically hemiclonic or generalized clonic in nature and are often triggered by fever. Following initial seizure events, one may observe the gradual onset of behavioral disorders and cognitive decline. The patient may also begin to experience other types of seizures such as myoclonic, absence, focal, and generalized tonic-clonic. Non-convulsive status epilepticus and signs of epileptic encephalopathy may also be seen."
