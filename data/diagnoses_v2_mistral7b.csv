An echocardiogram or ventilation-perfusion scan may be necessary to diagnose this condition.

+6. Anxiety or panic disorder: These conditions can cause symptoms such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue. However, the patient's edema and elevated BNP and troponin levels are not typically associated with anxiety or panic disorder. A mental health evaluation may be necessary to diagnose this condition.

+7. Diabetes: While not directly related to the patient's symptoms, diabetes can contribute to heart failure and other cardiovascular conditions, which may explain the patient's symptoms and lab results. However, the patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations are common in both diabetes and heart conditions, making it difficult to definitively diagnose based on these symptoms alone. Further testing, such as an A1C test, may be necessary to diagnose diabetes."

A heart murmur may be present if there is damage to the heart valves due to the buildup of toxins in the body. +4. Anemia: Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of anemia. Frequent respiratory infections may be present due to a weakened immune system. A lack of appetite may be present due to the body's decreased energy levels.
