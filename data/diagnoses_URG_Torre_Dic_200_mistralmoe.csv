A la auscultación mejoría de la entrada de aire en forma bilateral.-"," Based on the information provided, I have compiled a list of potential diseases that could match the patient's symptoms and test results. The patient is a 54-year-old male, with a specialty in Emergency Medicine, presenting with difficulty breathing (dyspnea) that does not improve with BiPAP, no fever, and a recent flu and COVID-19 vaccination. The patient's examination shows normal vital signs, lungs clear to auscultation, and no signs of heart failure or abdominal issues. The chest X-ray is clear, and the blood work shows mild anemia, normal electrolytes, and normal kidney function. The COVID-19 antigen test is negative.

Here are the potential diseases with the corresponding symptom matches and mismatches:

1. +1. Asthma:
	* Matches: Dyspnea, normal chest X-ray, possible wheezing (discussed in exploracion but not explicitly present)
	* Mismatches: No history of asthma, no response to BiPAP, no improvement with corticosteroids
2. +2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):
	* Matches: Dyspnea, normal chest X-ray, possible wheezing (discussed in exploracion but not explicitly present)
	* Mismatches: No history of COPD, no response to BiPAP, no improvement with corticosteroids
3. +3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE):
	* Matches: Dyspnea, tachypnea, possible hypoxia (Sat. O2 95%)
	* Mismatches: No chest pain, no hemoptysis, normal D-dimer (not provided)
4. +4. Pneumothorax:
	* Matches: Dyspnea, tachypnea, normal chest X-ray
	* Mismatches: No chest pain, no decreased breath sounds, no tracheal deviation (not mentioned)
5. +5. Pneumonia:
	* Matches: Dyspnea, tachypnea, possible cough (not mentioned)
	* Mismatches: Normal chest X-ray, no fever, normal WBC (not provided)
6. +6. Heart Failure:
	* Matches: Dyspnea, possible crackles on auscultation (not mentioned)
	* Mismatches: Normal vital signs, no peripheral edema, normal chest X-ray, no signs of heart failure on examination
7. +7. Anxiety Disorder:
	* Matches: Dyspnea, normal chest X-ray
	* Mismatches: No history of anxiety, no response to BiPAP, no improvement with corticosteroids

Based on the information provided, it is challenging to pinpoint a specific diagnosis. However, given the patient's lack of response to BiPAP and corticosteroids, as well as the negative COVID-19 antigen test, it is less likely to be an infectious process or a respiratory condition that responds to bronchodilators. A pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax cannot be ruled out based on the information provided, and further evaluation is necessary."

Note that this list is not exhaustive and is meant to provide a starting point for further evaluation.

1. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
	+ The patient is experiencing vertigo triggered by changes in position, which is a common symptom of BPPV. However, the patient has been treated with sulpirida, which is not typically used for BPPV.
2. Vestibular Migraine
	+ Vertigo can be a symptom of vestibular migraine, but the patient does not report any headaches.
3. Meniere's Disease
	+ Meniere's disease can cause vertigo, but it typically includes symptoms like tinnitus and hearing loss, which are not mentioned in this case.
4. Labyrinthitis
	+ Labyrinthitis is an inner ear infection that can cause vertigo, but the patient does not report any signs of infection, such as fever or ear pain.
5. Acoustic Neuroma
	+ Acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that can cause vertigo, but it usually develops gradually and is associated with hearing loss, which is not mentioned in this case.
6. Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency
	+ Vertigo can be a symptom of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which is reduced blood flow to the back of the brain. However, the patient does not report any other symptoms associated with this condition, such as difficulty speaking, swallowing, or walking.
7. Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
	+ MS can cause vertigo, but it is usually associated with other neurological symptoms, which are not mentioned in this case.

It is important to note that the patient has been evaluated by an ORL specialist and had normal vestibular tests, which may help narrow down the list of potential causes. Further evaluation, such as imaging studies or additional tests, may be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis."

+1. Renal colic: The patient presented with sudden onset of severe, colicky abdominal pain localized in the flank radiating towards the renal area, which are common symptoms of renal colic. The patient did not receive any analgesic treatment at home, and the physical examination revealed tenderness in the right flank without peritoneal reaction or defense, which supports the suspicion of renal colic. The Hct, Hb, GB, Plaq, Glu, Creat, Na, and K values are within normal ranges, which also supports this diagnosis. However, the Rx abdomen AP did not show any lithiasic images in the urinary tract, which is a common finding in renal colic.

+2. Diverticulitis: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of abdominal pain and tenderness in the right flank could also be consistent with diverticulitis. However, the absence of fever, leukocytosis, and peritoneal reaction or defense makes this diagnosis less likely.

+3. Appendicitis: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of abdominal pain and tenderness in the right flank could also be consistent with appendicitis. However, the absence of fever, leukocytosis, and peritoneal reaction or defense makes this diagnosis less likely.

+4. Inflammatory bowel disease: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of abdominal pain and tenderness in the right flank could also be consistent with inflammatory bowel disease. However, the absence of diarrhea, weight loss, and other gastrointestinal symptoms makes this diagnosis less likely.

+5. Intestinal obstruction: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of abdominal pain and tenderness in the right flank could also be consistent with intestinal obstruction. However, the absence of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension makes this diagnosis less likely.

Based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is renal colic. However, further evaluation and imaging studies may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms."

2. Nasal fracture: +
The patient has a history of trauma to the nose, and while the X-ray shows no acute bone injuries, a nasal fracture could still be a possibility. Sometimes, fractures may not be visible on X-rays, especially if they are hairline fractures or if the trauma occurred a few days ago.

Symptoms not present: No crepitations or deformities were noted during the examination, which would typically be associated with a nasal fracture.

3. Epistaxis (nosebleed): -
The patient does not mention any active nosebleed, so this condition is less likely. However, it could still be a possibility given the recent trauma to the nose.

Symptoms not present: The patient does not report any active nosebleed.

4. Rhinitis: -
Rhinitis is inflammation of the nasal passages, often causing symptoms like a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, and itching. The patient's symptoms do not align with rhinitis, as they are related to a recent trauma.

Symptoms not present: The patient does not report any symptoms associated with rhinitis.

5. Sinusitis: -
Sinusitis is inflammation or infection of the sinuses, often causing symptoms like facial pain, congestion, and thick nasal discharge. The patient's symptoms do not align with sinusitis, as they are related to a recent trauma.

+3. Gastritis: The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting could be caused by gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. However, there are no other symptoms or test results that support this diagnosis.

+4. Pancreatitis: The patient's abdominal pain and vomiting could be caused by pancreatitis, but the patient's amylase and transaminase levels are normal, which would not be expected in pancreatitis.

+5. Appendicitis: The patient's abdominal pain and vomiting could be caused by appendicitis, but the patient does not have fever or rebound tenderness, which are common symptoms of this condition.

+6. Cholecystitis: The patient's right upper quadrant abdominal pain and vomiting could be caused by cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. The patient's right hilar thickening on chest X-ray could also suggest this diagnosis.

+7. Pyelonephritis: The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting could be caused by pyelonephritis, which is a kidney infection. However, the patient does not have fever or costovertebral angle tenderness, which are common symptoms of this condition.

+8. Pneumonia: The patient's right hilar thickening on chest X-ray could suggest pneumonia, but the patient is afebrile and has no other symptoms of respiratory infection.

+9. Musculoskeletal pain: The patient's abdominal pain could be caused by musculoskeletal pain, which is not uncommon in the elderly. However, the patient's other symptoms and test results do not support this diagnosis.

Decreased renal perfusion leading to decreased glomerular filtration rate, often due to hypovolemia or decreased cardiac output. The patient is presenting with difficulty in diuresis, which can be a symptom of prerenal azotemia.

+2. Acute kidney injury (AKI):
Sudden loss of kidney function, which can be caused by various factors such as decreased renal perfusion, sepsis, or nephrotoxic agents. The patient's difficulty in diuresis could indicate AKI.

+3. Urinary tract infection (UTI):
Infection involving the urinary tract, often caused by bacteria. The patient mentions polaquiuria, which can be a symptom of UTI. However, the absence of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain makes UTI less likely.

+4. Pyelonephritis:
Infection of the renal pelvis and kidney parenchyma, usually caused by bacterial ascension from the lower urinary tract. The patient's piuria might suggest pyelonephritis, but the absence of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain makes this diagnosis less likely.

+5. Nephrolithiasis:
Presence of kidney stones, which can cause pain, hematuria, and difficulty in diuresis. The patient's symptoms do not include pain or hematuria, making nephrolithiasis less likely.

+6. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH):
Enlargement of the prostate gland in men, which can cause lower urinary tract symptoms such as difficulty in initiating urination, weak urinary stream, and nocturia. Since the patient is a woman, BPH is not applicable.

+7. Overactive bladder (OAB):
A syndrome characterized by urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urge incontinence. The patient's polaquiuria could be a symptom of OAB, but the absence of incontinence and the gender of the patient make this diagnosis less likely.

Please note that this is only a hypothetical diagnosis, and the patient should consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.

Here are some potential diseases:

+1. Myofascial Pain Syndrome: The patient's complaint of muscle pain and stiffness in the shoulder and neck region, specifically in the trapecius muscle, is a common symptom of myofascial pain syndrome. This condition is characterized by the presence of trigger points in the muscles, which can cause pain and stiffness in the affected area.

+2. Rotator Cuff Injury: The patient's complaint of pain in the shoulder region could also be due to a rotator cuff injury. The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint and help to stabilize and move the shoulder. Injury to the rotator cuff can cause pain, weakness, and limited range of motion in the shoulder.

+3. Referred Pain: The patient's complaint of pain in the shoulder region could also be due to referred pain from another location in the body. Referred pain occurs when pain is felt in a different location than where the actual injury or disease is present. For example, a heart attack can sometimes cause pain to be felt in the shoulder or arm.

+4. Brachial Plexus Injury: The patient's complaint of pain in the shoulder region could also be due to an injury to the brachial plexus, a network of nerves that run from the neck and shoulder down the arm. Injury to the brachial plexus can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected arm and hand.

+5. Osteoarthritis: The patient's age (43 years old) and complaint of shoulder pain could also be indicative of osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that can affect any joint in the body, including the shoulder. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joint, which can cause pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion.

The patient's normal temperature and absence of nausea or vomiting suggest that this may not be the primary diagnosis, but it cannot be ruled out entirely.

+2. Diverticulitis: This is an inflammation of the diverticula, small pouches that form in the wall of the colon. The patient's symptoms of left-sided abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits are consistent with diverticulitis. However, the absence of fever and severe pain suggests that this may not be the primary diagnosis.

+3. Gastroenteritis: This is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, which can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's absence of fever and vomiting suggests that this may not be the primary diagnosis, but it cannot be ruled out entirely.

+4. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): This is a group of chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestine, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The patient's symptoms of left-sided abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits are consistent with IBD. However, the absence of fever and severe pain suggests that this may not be the primary diagnosis.

+5. Ectopic pregnancy: This is a pregnancy that develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. The patient's age and gender suggest that this may not be the primary diagnosis, but it cannot be ruled out entirely.

+6. Ovarian cyst: This is a fluid-filled sac that forms on the ovary. The patient's age and gender suggest that this may not be the primary diagnosis, but it cannot be ruled out entirely.

Based on the patient's examination results, here are some additional potential diseases:

+7. Musculoskeletal strain: The patient's normal vital signs, absence of peritoneal signs, and palpable cecal margin suggest that the pain may be musculoskeletal in origin.

+8. Referred pain: The patient's normal vital signs, absence of peritoneal signs, and palpable cecal margin suggest that the pain may be referred from another location, such as the back or the chest.

In conclusion, the patient's symptoms and examination results suggest a possible diagnosis of diverticulitis or musculoskeletal strain. However, further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms."

2. +2. Constipation: The patient does not mention any changes in bowel movements, but constipation can sometimes present with abdominal pain. It is essential to explore this possibility further.
3. +3. Gastroenteritis: Although the patient does not mention any vomiting or diarrhea, gastroenteritis can sometimes present with abdominal pain as the only symptom.
4. +4. Appendicitis: The patient mentions that the pain is located on the right side, which could indicate appendicitis. However, the absence of fever, rebound tenderness, and guarding during the examination makes this less likely.
5. +5. Meckel's Diverticulum: Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital condition that can present with abdominal pain. However, this is more common in younger children and is usually associated with rectal bleeding.
6. +6. Intussusception: Intussusception is a condition where one part of the intestine telescopes into another, causing obstruction and ischemia. It can present with abdominal pain, but it is more common in children under two years of age.
7. +7. Ovarian Cyst: Although the patient is only 14 years old, an ovarian cyst could be a possibility. However, this is more common in older adolescents and is usually associated with pelvic pain.
8. +8. Ectopic Pregnancy: Although this is highly unlikely in a 14-year-old, it is essential to rule out ectopic pregnancy as a possibility.
9. +9. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, can present with abdominal pain. However, this is more common in older adolescents and young adults.
10. +10. Testicular Torsion: Although this is not a possibility in this patient, it is essential to rule out testicular torsion as a differential diagnosis in male patients with abdominal pain.

Please note that this is only a preliminary assessment and further examination and testing would be needed to make a definitive diagnosis.

Here are some potential diseases:

+1. Upper Respiratory Infection (URI): The patient is experiencing a catarrhal presentation, which is a common symptom of a URI. The patient's age, sex, and the fact that they have no significant medical history also support this diagnosis.

+2. Otitis Media: The patient's oropharynx is hyperemic, and the right eardrum is slightly reddened, which could indicate an ear infection.

+3. Tonsillitis: The patient's oropharynx is hyperemic, which could indicate an inflammation of the tonsils.

+4. Pharyngitis: The patient's oropharynx is hyperemic, which could indicate an inflammation of the pharynx.

+5. Sinusitis: The patient's catarrhal presentation could be due to a sinus infection.

+6. Allergic Rhinitis: The patient's symptoms could be caused by an allergic reaction, which would be more likely in a pediatric patient.

For each of these potential diseases, the patient has in common:

* Sex: Female
* Age: 7 years old
* Specialty: Pediatrics
* Symptoms: Catarrhal presentation
* Exploration: Hyperemic oropharynx

For each of these potential diseases, the patient does not have in common:

* Antecedents: None reported
* Maximum and minimum blood pressure: Not reported

+1. Otitis media: The patient is experiencing otalgia (ear pain) and the right eardrum is red and bulging, which are common symptoms of otitis media. This condition is often accompanied by upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as a runny nose and cough.

+2. Mastoiditis: This is an infection of the mastoid process, which is the bony prominence behind the ear. It can cause ear pain, fever, and swelling or redness behind the ear. However, the patient's temperature is normal, which may argue against this diagnosis.

+3. External otitis: Also known as swimmer's ear, this condition is caused by an infection of the ear canal. It can cause ear pain, especially when the ear is tugged or pushed on. The patient's symptoms of a red, bulging eardrum are not typical of external otitis, but it is still a possibility.

+4. Referred pain: Sometimes, pain in one part of the body can be caused by a problem in another part of the body. For example, throat infections or dental problems can sometimes cause ear pain. However, the patient's oropharynx is red, which may suggest a local cause of the otalgia.

+1. Constipation: The patient has been experiencing difficulty passing stools for 10 days, with the last bowel movement 10 days ago. She also reports seeing bright red blood during defecation. The abdominal exam shows no tenderness or signs of peritoneal irritation, and rectal exam reveals a small anal fissure and stool in the rectal vault. A rectal exam can help diagnose constipation and rule out other causes of rectal bleeding.

+2. Diverticular disease: The patient's abdominal pain is localized to the left lower quadrant, which could suggest diverticular disease. Diverticulosis is a common condition in which small pouches form in the wall of the colon, and diverticulitis occurs when these pouches become inflamed or infected. The patient's history of constipation and straining during bowel movements could increase her risk of developing diverticular disease.

+3. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. The patient's symptoms of constipation and abdominal pain could be consistent with IBS, but other causes of constipation need to be ruled out first.

+4. Colon cancer: The patient's history of constipation and bright red blood in the stool could be concerning for colon cancer. However, the absence of other symptoms such as weight loss, anemia, or changes in bowel habits makes this less likely.

+5. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): IBD is a chronic inflammatory condition that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's symptoms of constipation and abdominal pain could be consistent with IBD, but other symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, and fatigue are typically present.

Based on the patient's symptoms and the physical exam, constipation is the most likely diagnosis. However, further testing such as imaging or colonoscopy may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms."

+'1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient presents with dysuria and increased urinary frequency, which are common symptoms of a UTI. However, there is no reported abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or altered bowel habits, which are also common symptoms of a UTI. The urinalysis shows leukocyturia and hematuria, which support the diagnosis of a UTI.

+'2. Prostatitis: The patient is a 60-year-old male, which is the typical age group for prostatitis. However, the patient does not report any genitourinary or systemic symptoms that are commonly associated with prostatitis, such as fever, chills, perineal pain, or difficulty initiating or maintaining a urine stream.

+'3. Pyelonephritis: The patient's urinalysis shows leukocyturia and hematuria, which can be indicative of pyelonephritis. However, the patient does not report any flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness, which are common symptoms of pyelonephritis.

+'4. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's urinalysis shows hematuria, which can be indicative of nephrolithiasis. However, the patient does not report any colicky flank or abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or hematuria that are commonly associated with nephrolithiasis.

+'5. Bacteremia: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated PCR support the diagnosis of bacteremia. However, the patient does not report any symptoms that are commonly associated with bacteremia, such as fever, chills, or hypotension.

+'6. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated PCR support the diagnosis of sepsis. However, the patient does not report any symptoms that are commonly associated with sepsis, such as fever, chills, hypotension, or altered mental status.

+'7. Appendicitis: The patient does not report any abdominal pain, which is the most common symptom of appendicitis. The abdominal examination is also unremarkable.

+'8. Diverticulitis: The patient does not report any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or altered bowel habits, which are common symptoms of diverticulitis. The abdominal examination is also unremarkable.

+'9. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): The patient does not report any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or altered bowel habits, which are common symptoms of IBD. The abdominal examination is also unremarkable.

+'10. Pancreatitis: The patient does not report any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or altered bowel habits, which are common symptoms of pancreatitis. The abdominal examination is also unremarkable.

Based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is a UTI. The patient's symptoms of dysuria and increased urinary frequency, along with the urinalysis showing leukocyturia and hematuria, support this diagnosis.

+1. Musculoskeletal Strain: The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of trauma surgery, presenting with lower back pain. Musculoskeletal strain is a common cause of lower back pain, which can occur due to sudden movements, lifting heavy objects, or overuse. The patient's occupation as a traumatologist may put him at a higher risk of developing this condition.

+2. Degenerative Disc Disease: The patient's X-ray report shows degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. Degenerative disc disease is a condition that causes the intervertebral discs in the spine to break down over time, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility. The patient's age and occupation may also increase the likelihood of this condition.

+3. Herniated Disc: A herniated disc occurs when the soft inner material of the intervertebral disc bulges out through a tear in the outer layer. This can cause pressure on the surrounding nerves, leading to pain, numbness, or weakness in the lower back and legs. The patient's X-ray report shows a marked angulation in the lumbar sacral region, which may indicate a herniated disc.

+4. Spinal Stenosis: Spinal stenosis is a condition that causes narrowing of the spinal canal, leading to pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the lower back and legs. The patient's age and occupation may increase the likelihood of this condition.

+5. Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that can affect any joint in the body, including the spine. It is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility. The patient's age and occupation may increase the likelihood of this condition.

+6. Ankylosing Spondylitis: Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine. It causes inflammation in the joints and ligaments of the spine, leading to pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility. The patient's age and occupation may increase the likelihood of this condition.

The patient does not have any symptoms of fever, hypoglycemia, or decreased urine output, which can be indicative of other medical conditions. However, further diagnostic tests may be required to confirm the exact diagnosis."

+2. Herniated Disc: The patient's MRI report from November shows a denervation of the L5 nerve root on the right side, which could indicate a herniated disc. The chronic denervation of the S1 nerve root on the right side could also suggest this diagnosis.

+3. Sciatica: The patient's symptoms of lower back pain and pain in the leg could indicate sciatica, which is caused by compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve.

+4. Spinal Stenosis: The patient's age (21) is relatively young for this diagnosis, but spinal stenosis can occur in younger individuals due to genetic factors or trauma. The lower back pain could be caused by spinal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the spinal canal.

+5. Osteoarthritis: While osteoarthritis is more common in older individuals, it can occur in younger people as well. The lower back pain could be caused by osteoarthritis in the facet joints of the spine.

+6. Spondylolisthesis: This condition occurs when one vertebra slips forward over the one below it, which can cause lower back pain. However, there is no mention of any abnormalities in the patient's spine that would suggest this diagnosis.

The patient is a 21-year-old woman who specializes in traumatology and presented to the emergency department with lower back pain.

+1. Musculoskeletal Strain: The patient is a 68-year-old woman who experienced a fall and now has pain in her cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions. Musculoskeletal strain is a common injury resulting from overstretching or tearing of muscles and tendons. In this case, the patient's trauma history supports this potential diagnosis.

+2. Whiplash Associated Disorders (WAD): WAD is a common injury resulting from rapid acceleration-deceleration movements, such as those experienced during a fall. Symptoms include neck pain, stiffness, and tenderness, which can radiate to the shoulders, arms, and back. The patient's trauma history and pain in the cervical and dorsal regions support this potential diagnosis.

+3. Disc Herniation: A disc herniation occurs when the inner, softer material of an intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures through its outer, fibrous ring. This can cause pressure on nearby nerves, resulting in pain, numbness, or weakness. The patient's pain in the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions could be indicative of this condition.

+4. Spinal Stenosis: Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal, which can put pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Symptoms include pain, numbness, and weakness in the back, legs, and neck. While the patient's trauma history may not be directly related to spinal stenosis, it is still a potential diagnosis given the pain in the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions.

+5. Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that can affect any joint in the body, including the spine. Symptoms include pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. The patient's age and pain in the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions support this potential diagnosis.

+6. Fracture: While the X-ray did not reveal any vertebral fractures, it is still possible that the patient has a hairline or undetected fracture. The patient's trauma history and pain in the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions support this potential diagnosis.

It is important to note that the patient's vital signs, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, are within normal ranges, which is a positive sign. However, further evaluation, such as an MRI or CT scan, may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis."

1. Epidural Hematoma: The patient experienced a traumatic brain injury (TCE) with an object causing the trauma. Epidural hematoma can occur due to trauma, leading to bleeding in the space between the skull and the dura mater, causing increased intracranial pressure. However, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale is 15, which is a good sign against this diagnosis.

+2. Concussion: A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury caused by a blow to the head or body, leading to a temporary disruption of normal brain function. The patient has a history of head trauma and reports a headache. However, there is no mention of any loss of consciousness or vomiting, which are common symptoms of concussion.

+3. Cervical Strain: The patient mentions neck pain (cervicalgia) after the accident. Cervical strain is a common injury resulting from rapid movement of the neck and head, which can occur during a traumatic event.

+4. Post-Concussion Syndrome: This condition can occur following a concussion and is characterized by persistent symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and memory problems. However, the patient does not report any other symptoms typically associated with post-concussion syndrome.

+5. Skull Fracture: A skull fracture can occur due to a traumatic brain injury. However, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale is 15, which is a good sign against this diagnosis.

+6. Contusion: A contusion is a bruise on the brain caused by trauma. It can cause symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and memory problems. However, the patient does not report any other symptoms typically associated with contusions.

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a medical specialty in emergency medicine who experienced a traumatic brain injury (TCE) after being hit by an object.

+2. Sinusitis: Inflammation of the sinuses, often caused by infection. The patient's symptoms of congestion and cough could be related to sinusitis, but the absence of fever, facial pain, and purulent nasal discharge make this less likely.

+3. Asthma: A chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. The patient's symptoms of cough and congestion could be related to asthma, but the absence of wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness make this less likely.

+4. Pneumonia: Inflammation of the lungs, often caused by infection. The patient's symptoms of cough and congestion could be related to pneumonia, but the absence of fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain make this less likely.

+5. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): A condition where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, and cough. The patient's symptoms of cough and chest discomfort could be related to GERD, but the absence of heartburn and regurgitation make this less likely.

Based on the patient's medical history, examination results, and test results, the most likely diagnosis is COVID-19 infection. The patient's positive antigen test and symptoms of cough and congestion are consistent with this diagnosis. The absence of fever, shortness of breath, and chest pain make this a less severe case of COVID-19. However, the patient's age and occupation as a physician in the emergency department put them at higher risk for complications, so close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary."

I will provide possible diseases with a '+' and a number, followed by the name of the disease and a description of how the patient's symptoms align with the disease.

+1. Common Cold: A viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, typically characterized by symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and cough. The patient's symptoms of mucus nasal discharge, cough, and the recent onset of the illness align with this diagnosis.

+2. Pharyngitis: Inflammation of the pharynx, which can be viral or bacterial (such as streptococcal pharyngitis or ""strep throat""). The patient's oropharyngeal hyperemia (redness) could indicate pharyngitis, but the absence of fever and exanthem (rash) makes streptococcal pharyngitis less likely.

+3. Bronchiolitis: A viral infection that affects the bronchioles, typically caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This condition is more common in infants and young children. The patient's age and symptoms of mucus nasal discharge and cough could suggest bronchiolitis, but the absence of respiratory distress or wheezing makes this less likely.

+4. Sinusitis: Inflammation of the sinuses, which can be viral or bacterial. The patient's symptoms of mucus nasal discharge and cough could indicate sinusitis, but the absence of facial pain or pressure makes this less likely.

+5. Croup: A viral infection that causes inflammation and swelling of the upper airways, typically in children under 5 years old. The patient's age and symptoms of cough could suggest croup, but the absence of stridor (a harsh, high-pitched sound when breathing in) makes this less likely.

The patient's symptoms are most consistent with a common cold (URTI). However, if the patient's condition worsens or new symptoms develop, it is essential to reevaluate the diagnosis."

+2. Laceration: The patient has a small excoriation in the mandibular region, indicating a possible laceration or cut.

+3. Loss of Consciousness: The patient reports having lost consciousness for a few seconds, which could indicate a concussion or other head injury.

+4. Neurological Examination without Focal Findings: The patient's neurological examination did not reveal any focal findings, which is a positive sign and suggests that the brain function is intact.

+5. Normal Cranial Nerves: The patient's cranial nerves were found to be normal during the examination, indicating that the brain and surrounding structures are functioning correctly.

+6. Normal Cerebellar Function: The patient's cerebellar function was found to be normal during the examination, suggesting that the patient's balance, coordination, and fine motor skills are intact.

+7. Hypotension: The patient's maximum blood pressure was recorded at 108 mmHg, which is lower than the normal range of 120/80 mmHg. This could indicate hypotension or low blood pressure.

+8. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate was recorded at 70 beats per minute, which is within the normal range of 60-100 beats per minute. However, given the patient's young age and the trauma facial, it is essential to monitor the heart rate for any changes.

+9. Normal Temperature: The patient's temperature was recorded at 36.1°C, which is within the normal range of 36.5-37.5°C.

+10. Normal Oxygen Saturation: The patient's oxygen saturation was recorded at 98%, which is within the normal range of 95-100%.

+11. Normal Blood Glucose: Although the patient's blood glucose level was not recorded, it is essential to monitor it as a sudden drop in blood glucose can cause symptoms similar to trauma.

+12. Normal Urine Output: Although the patient's urine output was not recorded, it is essential to monitor it as a decrease in urine output can indicate dehydration or other medical conditions.

+13. Concussion: The patient's loss of consciousness could indicate a concussion, which is a mild traumatic brain injury that can occur when the brain is jolted or shaken violently.

+14. Skull Fracture: Although the patient's neurological examination did not reveal any focal findings, it is essential to monitor for any signs of a skull fracture, which can occur with facial trauma.

+15. Dental Injury: The patient's trauma facial could have caused dental injuries, such as chipped or loose teeth, or even tooth loss.

+16. Soft Tissue Injury: The patient's trauma facial could have caused soft tissue injuries, such as bruises, swelling, or cuts.

+2. Tonsillitis: The patient's oropharynx examination is normal, which makes this diagnosis less likely. However, the patient's symptoms of painful swallowing could be caused by inflammation of the tonsils.

+3. Candida esophagitis: The patient mentioned a white coating on the tongue, which could be a sign of candida infection. If the candida has spread to the esophagus, it could cause painful swallowing. However, the patient does not have other symptoms associated with candida esophagitis, such as difficulty swallowing or chest pain.

+4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient's symptoms of painful swallowing and sensation of a lump in the throat could be caused by GERD. However, the patient does not have other symptoms associated with GERD, such as heartburn or regurgitation.

+5. Herpangina: The patient's symptoms of painful swallowing and fever could be caused by herpangina, a viral infection that typically affects children. However, the patient's age and the absence of fever make this diagnosis less likely.

Based on the patient's medical history, she is a healthcare worker in the emergency department and has recently recovered from COVID-19. Therefore, it is important to consider post-COVID-19 complications, such as:

+6. Post-viral odynophagia: The patient's symptoms of painful swallowing could be caused by post-viral odynophagia, a condition that can occur after a viral infection. This condition is usually self-limiting and resolves within a few days to a week.

The patient's vital signs and physical examination are normal, which makes serious conditions such as epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, or esophageal perforation less likely. However, these conditions should be considered in patients with severe symptoms or those who do not respond to initial treatment."

+'1. Pleurisy: The patient's symptom of sharp pain during inspiration, which is localized to the left intercostal area, is consistent with pleurisy. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms such as cough, fever, or shortness of breath, which are commonly associated with pleurisy.

+'2. Pneumothorax: The patient's symptom of sharp pain during inspiration, which is localized to the left intercostal area, could be indicative of a pneumothorax. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, or decreased breath sounds, which are commonly associated with pneumothorax. Additionally, the chest X-ray did not show any signs of a pneumothorax.

+'3. Musculoskeletal pain: The patient's symptom of sharp pain during inspiration, which is localized to the left intercostal area, could be due to musculoskeletal pain. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms such as tenderness, swelling, or decreased range of motion, which are commonly associated with musculoskeletal pain.

+'4. Costochondritis: The patient's symptom of sharp pain during inspiration, which is localized to the left intercostal area, could be indicative of costochondritis. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms such as tenderness, swelling, or redness, which are commonly associated with costochondritis.

+'5. Pulmonary embolism: Although the patient does not have any symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, or chest pain, the presence of a slightly elevated D-dimer level (291 ng/mL) could suggest a possible pulmonary embolism. However, the patient's normal chest X-ray and hemodynamic stability make this diagnosis less likely.

Based on the patient's test results, there are no other potential diseases that are likely given the absence of any abnormal findings. Therefore, the patient was discharged with recommendations and treatment."

+2. Acute otitis media: The patient's symptoms of otalgia (ear pain) and the otoscopic findings of a red and inflamed tympanic membrane could also be consistent with acute otitis media, which is an infection of the middle ear. However, the absence of fever and otorrhea (ear discharge) makes this diagnosis less likely.

+3. External otitis: The patient's symptoms of otalgia and the normal appearance of the tympanic membrane on otoscopy could suggest external otitis, which is an infection or inflammation of the ear canal. However, the absence of itching, discharge, or hearing loss makes this diagnosis less likely.

+4. Referred otalgia: The patient's otalgia could be referred from another site, such as the pharynx or the cervical spine. The patient's history of odinofagia (painful swallowing) and congestion nasal suggests a possible upper respiratory tract infection, which could cause referred otalgia.

+5. Eustachian tube dysfunction: The patient's sensation of taponamiento (blockage) in the ear could be due to eustachian tube dysfunction, which is a common condition that can cause conductive hearing loss and ear fullness. The eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx, and it can become obstructed or dysfunctional due to various factors, such as allergies, upper respiratory tract infections, or barotrauma.

The examination revealed pain in the peroneal tendons and Achilles tendon, but no pain in the fifth metatarsal or malleolus. The ankle stability is normal.

+1. Ankle sprain: This is the most likely diagnosis, as the patient experienced a forced maneuver leading to pain in the ankle, specifically in the peroneal tendons and Achilles tendon. An ankle sprain typically involves injury to the ligaments surrounding the ankle joint, often caused by sudden twisting or rolling of the ankle.

+2. Peroneal tendonitis: The pain in the peroneal tendons could indicate peroneal tendonitis, an inflammation of the peroneal tendons due to overuse or trauma. This condition is common in athletes and individuals who engage in activities that involve repetitive ankle motion.

+3. Achilles tendonitis: The pain in the Achilles tendon might suggest Achilles tendonitis, an inflammation of the Achilles tendon, usually caused by overuse or repetitive stress. This condition is common in runners and individuals who suddenly increase their physical activity.

For each of the proposed diseases, the patient has the following symptoms in common:

* Sex: Female
* Age: 17
* Specialty: Traumatology
* Symptoms: Pain in the left ankle, specifically in the peroneal tendons and Achilles tendon

For each of the proposed diseases, the patient does not have the following symptoms:

* There is no mention of a fever, low blood pressure, or abnormal heart rate, which would be indicative of a more systemic condition.
* The patient does not have pain in the fifth metatarsal or malleolus, which helps narrow down the diagnosis.
* The ankle stability is normal, which also supports the diagnosis of a localized soft tissue injury rather than a severe joint injury or fracture."

+3. Epiglottitis: The patient's symptoms of odynophagia, fever, and afonia (loss of voice) could indicate epiglottitis, an inflammation of the epiglottis that can cause swelling and blockage of the airway.

+4. Peritonsillar abscess: Although the patient's amygdalae are normal, a peritonsillar abscess can still cause painful swallowing and fever. The abscess can form around the tonsil and can cause trismus (difficulty opening the mouth) and muffled voice.

+5. Retropharyngeal abscess: The patient's symptoms of odynophagia, fever, and afonia could also indicate a retropharyngeal abscess, an abscess in the space behind the pharynx. This condition can cause difficulty swallowing, neck stiffness, and difficulty breathing.

+6. Influenza: The patient's fever and cough with expectoration could indicate influenza, a viral infection that can cause respiratory symptoms and fever.

+7. Streptococcal pharyngitis: Although the patient's amygdalae are normal, streptococcal pharyngitis, also known as strep throat, cannot be ruled out as a potential diagnosis. This bacterial infection can cause painful swallowing, fever, and lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes).

+'1. Renal Colic: The patient is a 50-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of severe left flank pain radiating to the hypogastrium, accompanied by nausea and hematuria. These symptoms align with renal colic, which is often caused by a kidney stone.

+'2. Pyelonephritis: The patient's symptoms, including left flank pain, nausea, and hematuria, could also indicate pyelonephritis, which is an infection of the kidney. However, the patient does not have a fever, which is a common symptom of pyelonephritis.

+'3. Diverticulitis: Although the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of a renal or urologic issue, diverticulitis is a possibility. Diverticulitis is an inflammation or infection of the diverticula, which are small pouches that form in the wall of the colon. The patient's pain could be related to diverticulitis, but the absence of fever, vomiting, and altered bowel movements makes this less likely.

+'4. Ectopic Pregnancy: The patient's symptoms could potentially indicate an ectopic pregnancy, which is a medical emergency. However, this is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of vaginal bleeding.

+'5. Ovarian Torsion: The patient's symptoms could also suggest ovarian torsion, which is a twisting of the ovary that can cut off its blood supply. However, this is also less likely given the patient's age and the absence of vaginal bleeding or a palpable mass.

+'6. Testicular Torsion: Although the patient is a woman, testicular torsion could be considered as a differential diagnosis if the patient has any abnormalities in her reproductive system. However, this is highly unlikely given the patient's sex.

+'7. Appendicitis: The patient's symptoms could potentially indicate appendicitis, but the absence of fever, vomiting, and altered bowel movements makes this less likely.

+'8. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): The patient's symptoms could also suggest IBD, but the absence of altered bowel movements, abdominal tenderness, and fever makes this less likely.

+'9. Meckel's Diverticulum: Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital abnormality of the intestine that can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and hematuria. However, this is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms.

+'10. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID): PID is an infection of the reproductive organs that can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and hematuria. However, this is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of vaginal discharge or fever.

The patient's symptoms are most suggestive of renal colic, but further evaluation and testing are necessary to confirm the diagnosis."

+1. Upper Respiratory Infection (URI): The patient has a fever and a cough, which are common symptoms of a URI. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms such as diarrhea or vomiting. The examination shows that the patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and there are no signs of lower respiratory infection.

+2. Pharyngitis: The patient has odinophagia (painful swallowing), which is a common symptom of pharyngitis. The examination shows that the oropharynx is red, but there are no exudates or membranes.

+3. Otitis Media: The examination shows that the patient's eardrums are red, which could indicate an ear infection. However, the patient does not report any ear pain or hearing loss.

+4. Bronchitis: The patient has a cough and a fever, which could indicate bronchitis. However, the examination shows that the patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and there are no signs of lower respiratory infection.

AP: MVC. No roncus ni crepitantes, Exploracion Compl.: Paul Bunnell (Mononucleosis) Negativo, Evolucion: NaN"," Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, here are some potential diseases:

+1. Pharyngitis: The patient reports a sore throat, which is a common symptom of pharyngitis. However, there are no signs of exudates or pus on the patient's throat, which can be a sign of bacterial pharyngitis. The patient's rapid strep test was negative, which also suggests that bacterial pharyngitis is less likely.

+2. Influenza: The patient has a fever, which is a common symptom of influenza. The patient also reports a cough and fatigue, which are also common symptoms of influenza. However, the patient does not report muscle aches or joint pain, which are also common symptoms of influenza.

+3. Mononucleosis: The patient's rapid strep test was negative, which suggests that bacterial pharyngitis is less likely. The patient's Paul Bunnell test for mononucleosis was also negative, but this test is not always accurate in the first few weeks of the illness. The patient's symptoms of fever, sore throat, and fatigue are consistent with mononucleosis, but the negative test result makes this diagnosis less likely.

+4. COVID-19: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and fatigue are consistent with COVID-19. However, the patient does not report shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, which are also common symptoms of COVID-19. The patient's oxygen saturation is normal, which also suggests that severe respiratory distress is less likely.

+5. Streptococcal Tonsillitis: The patient's symptoms of fever, sore throat, and fatigue are consistent with streptococcal tonsillitis. However, the patient's rapid strep test was negative, which suggests that bacterial pharyngitis is less likely. The patient's throat exam did not show any exudates or pus, which are common signs of streptococcal tonsillitis.

Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, pharyngitis and influenza are the most likely diagnoses. Mononucleosis and COVID-19 are less likely, but cannot be ruled out without further testing. Streptococcal tonsillitis is the least likely diagnosis, given the negative rapid strep test and the absence of exudates or pus on exam."

+1. Osteoarthritis (OA): The patient is a 61-year-old woman who experienced a fall two weeks ago and now has knee and leg pain. The X-ray shows degenerative changes in the knee, which is consistent with OA. However, the patient does not have limited mobility or joint swelling, which are common symptoms of OA.

+2. Muscle Strain: The patient's pain could be due to a muscle strain or tear, which can occur after a fall. However, the patient does not report any difficulty walking or reduced mobility, which are common symptoms of muscle strains.

+3. Bursitis: The patient's knee pain could be caused by inflammation of the bursa, a small fluid-filled sac that cushions the knee joint. Bursitis can cause pain and tenderness in the knee, but the patient does not report any swelling or redness, which are common symptoms of bursitis.

+4. Tendinitis: The patient's pain could be due to inflammation of the tendons around the knee joint. Tendinitis can cause pain and stiffness, but the patient does not report any swelling or warmth in the knee, which are common symptoms of tendinitis.

+5. Fracture: The patient's fall could have resulted in a fracture of the knee or leg bones. However, the patient does not report any deformity or inability to bear weight, which are common symptoms of fractures.

+6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's pain could be caused by a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg. However, the patient does not report any swelling, redness, or warmth in the leg, which are common symptoms of DVT.

+2. External otitis: The patient's ear pain and the feeling of fullness in the ear could be due to external otitis, an infection of the ear canal. The examination did not reveal any redness or swelling of the ear canal, but this does not rule out external otitis.

+3. Serous otitis media: The patient's ear pain and the redness of the eardrum in the left ear could be due to serous otitis media, a buildup of fluid behind the eardrum. This condition is often associated with colds or allergies, but the patient does not have a runny nose or other symptoms of a cold.

+4. Mastoiditis: The patient's ear pain and the redness of the eardrum in the left ear could be due to mastoiditis, an infection of the mastoid process, the bony prominence behind the ear. This condition is often associated with otitis media, but the patient does not have a fever.

+5. Referred pain: The patient's ear pain could be due to a problem elsewhere in the body, such as a toothache or a problem with the temporomandibular joint. The examination did not reveal any signs of these conditions.

The patient's oral examination shows a hyperemic and congested pharynx with follicular appearance, but no exudates. Both ears are normal. The respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are normal. There are no signs of meningeal irritation or focality.

Using the information provided, I propose the following list of potential diseases:

+1. Influenza: Influenza, or the flu, is a viral infection that affects the respiratory system. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, and fatigue. The patient's fever, cough, and nasal mucus could indicate influenza. However, the absence of sore throat and the normal respiratory examination argue against this diagnosis.

+2. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection: RSV is a common respiratory virus that typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms. However, in young children, it can lead to bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, and difficulty breathing. The patient's fever, cough, and nasal mucus could indicate RSV. However, the normal respiratory examination argues against this diagnosis.

+3. Streptococcal Pharyngitis: Also known as strep throat, streptococcal pharyngitis is a bacterial infection that causes a sore throat. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and headaches. The patient's fever and absence of sore throat argue against this diagnosis.

+4. Adenovirus Infection: Adenovirus is a viral infection that can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, and nasal congestion. The patient's fever, cough, and nasal mucus could indicate adenovirus. However, the absence of sore throat and the normal respiratory examination argue against this diagnosis.

+5. Epiglottitis: Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the epiglottis, a structure that covers the windpipe. Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing, and a muffled or hoarse voice. The patient's fever and cough could indicate epiglottitis. However, the normal respiratory examination and the absence of difficulty breathing or hoarse voice argue against this diagnosis.

+6. Pertussis (Whooping Cough): Pertussis is a bacterial infection that causes a severe cough. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The patient's fever and cough could indicate pertussis. However, the normal respiratory examination and the absence of difficulty breathing argue against this diagnosis.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a viral infection, such as influenza or RSV. However, further testing, such as a viral culture or PCR test, would be needed to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to monitor the patient's symptoms and seek further medical attention if they worsen or if the patient develops difficulty breathing."

+2. Blepharitis: The patient does not report any symptoms of blepharitis, such as itching, burning, or foreign body sensation in the eyes, but it is still a possibility. Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelids that can cause redness, swelling, and crusting of the eyelashes.

+3. Conjunctivitis: The patient does not report any symptoms of conjunctivitis, such as eye discharge, itching, or tearing, but it is still a possibility. Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin membrane that covers the inside of the eyelids and the white part of the eye.

+4. Keratitis: The patient does not report any symptoms of keratitis, such as eye pain, sensitivity to light, or blurred vision, but it is still a possibility. Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea, the clear front part of the eye, that can be caused by infection, injury, or other conditions.

+5. Iritis: The patient does not report any symptoms of iritis, such as eye pain, sensitivity to light, or blurred vision, but it is still a possibility. Iritis is an inflammation of the iris, the colored part of the eye, that can be caused by infection, injury, or other conditions.

+6. Acute Glaucoma: The patient does not report any symptoms of acute glaucoma, such as severe eye pain, nausea, or halos around lights, but it is still a possibility. Acute glaucoma is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent vision loss.

In conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms and examination results, the most likely diagnosis is a subconjunctival hemorrhage. However, other possibilities cannot be ruled out, and further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment."

+1. Cervical spondylosis: This is a common age-related condition that affects the joints and discs in the cervical spine. It can cause stiffness, pain, and decreased range of motion in the neck. The patient's symptoms of cervical pain and decreased range of motion, as well as the finding of degenerative changes on X-ray, suggest this as a possible diagnosis.

+2. Cervical radiculopathy: This occurs when a nerve in the cervical spine is compressed or irritated, often due to a herniated disc or degenerative changes. It can cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the neck, shoulder, arm, or hand. The patient's symptoms of cervical and arm pain, as well as the finding of degenerative changes on X-ray, suggest this as a possible diagnosis.

+3. Brachial plexus neuropathy: This is a condition that affects the network of nerves that sends signals from the spine to the shoulder, arm, and hand. It can cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in these areas. The patient's symptoms of arm pain and weakness, as well as the finding of degenerative changes on X-ray, suggest this as a possible diagnosis.

+4. Shoulder impingement syndrome: This occurs when the tendons in the shoulder become inflamed or damaged due to repetitive motion or overuse. It can cause pain, weakness, and decreased range of motion in the shoulder. The patient's symptoms of shoulder pain and decreased range of motion, as well as the finding of degenerative changes on X-ray, suggest this as a possible diagnosis.

+5. Rotator cuff tear: This is a tear in one of the tendons that make up the rotator cuff, a group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint. It can cause pain, weakness, and decreased range of motion in the shoulder.

+1. Allergies: The patient has a persistent cough and a runny nose, which could be caused by an allergic reaction to environmental factors such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander.

+2. Bronchitis: The patient's symptoms of a persistent cough and mucus production could indicate bronchitis, which is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes that carry air to the lungs.

+3. Croup: The patient's symptoms of a barking cough and noisy breathing could indicate croup, which is a viral infection that causes swelling in the upper airway.

+4. Epiglottitis: The patient's symptoms of a barking cough and noisy breathing could also indicate epiglottitis, which is a bacterial infection that causes swelling in the epiglottis, a flap of tissue that covers the windpipe during swallowing.

+5. Influenza: The patient's symptoms of a cough, runny nose, and headache could indicate influenza, which is a viral infection that affects the respiratory system.

+6. Pertussis (Whooping Cough): The patient's symptoms of a persistent cough and mucus production could indicate pertussis, which is a bacterial infection that affects the respiratory system and causes severe coughing fits.

+7. Sinusitis: The patient's symptoms of a runny nose and cough could indicate sinusitis, which is an inflammation of the sinuses that can cause mucus production and congestion.

+8. Asthma: The patient's symptoms of a cough and noisy breathing could indicate asthma, which is a chronic respiratory condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways.

+9. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of a cough and mucus production could indicate pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs that can cause inflammation and fluid buildup in the air sacs.

+10. Tuberculosis: The patient's symptoms of a persistent cough and mucus production could also indicate tuberculosis, which is a bacterial infection that affects the lungs and can cause coughing, chest pain, and weight loss.

The patient is a 12-year-old male with no significant medical history, presenting with a one-week history of dry, hacking cough and hoarseness, now with the addition of mucus production and chest noises. The patient also reports headaches. The patient is afebrile and well-hydrated, with normal vital signs. Physical examination reveals a well-appearing child with normal ear exams, clear nasal passages, normal lung exam with no wheezing or crackles, and normal cardiac exam. The patient's throat is mildly red without exudates or membranes.

Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a viral upper respiratory infection, such as a cold or bronchitis. The patient's dry cough and hoarseness may be due to postnasal drip or laryngitis, which can occur with viral infections. The addition of mucus production and chest noises may indicate a secondary bacterial infection, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. However, the patient's normal vital signs and lung exam make these diagnoses less likely. The patient's headaches may be related to sinus congestion or dehy"

+6. Orbital Cellulitis: Infection of the tissues surrounding the eye. Symptoms include redness, swelling, and pain. However, the patient does not report any swelling or pain.

Based on the patient's age, sex, and occupation as an emergency medicine physician, it is important to consider other potential causes of red eye, such as systemic conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus), medication side effects, or ocular manifestations of systemic infections (e.g., endocarditis, tuberculosis). The patient's lack of other symptoms and normal vital signs make these possibilities less likely, but they should still be considered in the differential diagnosis.

It is also important to note that the patient reports having engaged in exercise prior to the onset of symptoms. Exercise-induced transient benign hyperemia is a possible diagnosis, which is characterized by a self-limiting redness of the eye that occurs after exercise and resolves within a few hours. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's lack of other symptoms and the normal examination findings. However, it is important to rule out other more serious causes of red eye before making this diagnosis."

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and further examination and testing are required for a definitive diagnosis.

1. Migraine: The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a history of chronic headaches. She currently experiences a 2-day headache associated with nausea and vomiting. Migraines can present with these symptoms, but the absence of fever, diarrhea, chest pain, and dyspnea supports this possibility.

+2. Tension-type headache: This is another possibility for the patient's headache, as it is a common primary headache disorder. However, the presence of nausea and vomiting is not typical for tension-type headaches, which usually do not have associated gastrointestinal symptoms.

+3. Medication-overuse headache: Given the patient's history of chronic headaches and the mention of treatment with petidine, medication-overuse headache could be a possibility. This condition can result from overusing pain-relieving medications, causing a worsening of headaches over time.

+4. Cluster headache: Although cluster headaches are more common in men, they can also occur in women. Cluster headaches are usually one-sided, severe, and associated with autonomic symptoms such as redness and tearing of the eye, as well as nasal congestion. However, the patient's presentation does not mention these specific symptoms.

+5. Cervicogenic headache: This type of headache originates from the cervical spine and can be associated with neck pain or stiffness. The patient's presentation does not mention any neck-related symptoms.

The patient's neurological examination shows no focal neurological deficits other than a mild left-sided hemiparesis, which is known. The absence of other focal neurological signs makes it less likely that the headache is due to a secondary cause such as a brain tumor, meningitis, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, further evaluation and imaging may be necessary to rule out these possibilities."

Keep in mind that this is a hypothetical diagnosis, and the final diagnosis should be made by a healthcare professional.

1. Musculoskeletal strain: The patient reports a 4-day history of worsening femoral pain, which is exacerbated by movement, particularly when lifting the leg. This could indicate a musculoskeletal strain. However, the absence of localized swelling, erythema, or tenderness may suggest other possibilities.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient does not report calf pain or a positive Homans' sign, the presence of hospedalization and recent immobilization could still make DVT a possibility. The D-dimer result of 513 ng/mL is slightly elevated, which could suggest a venous thromboembolism. However, D-dimer can be elevated in various conditions, and a negative D-dimer usually rules out DVT.

3. Influenza or other viral illness: The patient mentions a 3-4 day history of nasal congestion, dry cough, and myalgias. These symptoms are consistent with a viral illness such as influenza. The absence of fever, dyspnea, or chest pain makes a severe bacterial infection less likely.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell indices are slightly elevated, which could indicate a mild form of anemia, such as microcytic or normocytic anemia. However, the absence of symptoms related to anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath, makes this less likely.

5. Dehydration: The patient's specific gravity is not provided, but the absence of symptoms related to dehydration, such as dry mouth, thirst, or decreased urine output, makes this less likely.

The patient's lab results do not show any significant abnormalities that would suggest a specific disease. The patient's hemodynamic stability, the absence of severe symptoms, and the normal lab results support an outpatient management approach. The patient should be advised to follow up with their primary care physician for further evaluation and management of their symptoms."

+1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient reports disuria, or painful urination, as well as increased frequency of urination (polaquiuria) and straining to urinate (tenesmo). These are common symptoms of a UTI. However, the patient does not report fever, nausea, or vomiting, which are also common symptoms of a UTI.

+2. Bladder Infection: The patient reports disuria, polaquiuria, and tenesmo, which are common symptoms of a bladder infection. The patient also reports that they had a bladder instillation the day before, which could potentially introduce bacteria and cause an infection. However, the patient does not report fever, which is a common symptom of a bladder infection.

+3. Interstitial Cystitis: The patient reports disuria, polaquiuria, and tenesmo, which are also common symptoms of interstitial cystitis. However, interstitial cystitis is a chronic condition, and the patient's symptoms have only been present for a few hours. Additionally, interstitial cystitis typically does not cause fever.

+4. Prostatitis: While the patient is female, it is worth mentioning that prostatitis can cause similar symptoms to those reported by the patient. Prostatitis is an inflammation of the prostate gland, which can cause disuria, polaquiuria, and tenesmo. However, this is unlikely given the patient's sex.

+5. Bladder Cancer: The patient's symptoms could potentially be caused by bladder cancer, but this is unlikely given the patient's age and the acute nature of the symptoms. Bladder cancer typically presents with painless hematuria, or blood in the urine, rather than disuria.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) or a bladder infection. However, further testing and evaluation may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes."

1. +1. Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS): The patient is an active 17-year-old female with knee pain related to sports activities. PFPS is a common cause of knee pain in this demographic, characterized by pain around the patella (kneecap), often worsened by activities that involve bending the knee, like running, jumping, or cycling.
2. +2. Osgood-Schlatter Disease: This condition is an overuse injury that typically affects adolescents during growth spurts. It causes pain and swelling in the front of the knee, just below the patella, which can be tender to the touch. The patient's age and symptoms suggest this as a potential cause.
3. +3. Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS): This condition causes pain on the outside of the knee, often related to repetitive motion or overuse. The patient's involvement in sports activities and knee pain could indicate ITBS, especially if the pain worsens with running or cycling.
4. +4. Meniscal Tears: Although the patient's examination results indicate no meniscal issues, meniscal tears can still be a possibility. These tears can cause knee pain, swelling, and stiffness, especially when twisting or rotating the knee.
5. +5. Chondromalacia Patella: This condition involves damage to the cartilage on the underside of the patella, leading to pain and inflammation. It is more common in young adults and can be related to overuse or misalignment of the patella.
6. +6. Bursitis: Inflammation of the bursae, small fluid-filled sacs that cushion the joints, can cause knee pain and swelling. Prepatellar bursitis, in particular, affects the front of the knee and can be related to frequent kneeling or overuse.

These are some potential causes of the patient's knee pain. Further evaluation, including imaging studies and a physical examination, will be necessary to make an accurate diagnosis."

+1. Gastroenteritis: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea, which are common symptoms of gastroenteritis. However, there is no fever or vomiting, which can also be symptoms of this disease.

+2. Gastritis: The patient's abdominal pain is localized to the epigastrium, which is where the stomach is located. This, along with the absence of fever or vomiting, could suggest gastritis. However, the patient's hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are within normal range, which would not be expected in severe gastritis.

+3. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea could be consistent with IBS. However, IBS is typically a diagnosis of exclusion, and other potential causes of the patient's symptoms would need to be ruled out.

+4. Food Poisoning: The patient's symptoms of nausea and diarrhea, along with the fact that there are other students in the patient's class with similar symptoms, could suggest food poisoning. However, there is no vomiting or fever, which are common symptoms of this disease.

+5. Constipation: While the patient does not report constipation, it is possible that the patient's abdominal pain is related to constipation. However, this would not explain the patient's nausea and diarrhea.

+6. Appendicitis: The patient's abdominal pain is localized to the epigastrium, which is not the typical location for appendicitis. However, appendicitis can present atypically, and the patient's age is within the typical range for this disease.

+7. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea could be consistent with IBD. However, the patient's hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are within normal range, which would not be expected in severe IBD.

+8. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea could be consistent with mesenteric ischemia. However, this is a rare disease, particularly in young patients, and the patient's hemodynamic parameters are within normal range.

+9. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea could be consistent with small bowel obstruction. However, this is typically associated with vomiting, which the patient does not report.

+10. Diverticulitis: The patient's abdominal pain is localized to the epigastrium, which is not the typical location for diverticulitis. However, diverticulitis can present atypically, and the patient's age is within the typical range for this disease.

Based on the patient's test results, there are no abnormalities in the hematologic or biochemical parameters that would suggest a specific diagnosis. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, which would not be expected in many of the potential diseases listed above. However, further evaluation, such as imaging studies or endoscopy, may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis."

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and further diagnostic testing may be required to confirm the exact diagnosis.

+1. Muscle Strain: The patient is experiencing pain in both thighs, which could be indicative of a muscle strain. This is a common injury in athletes and can occur due to overuse or sudden trauma. The pain is usually localized to the site of injury and may be accompanied by swelling and bruising.

+2. Bursitis: Bursitis is the inflammation of the bursae, which are small fluid-filled sacs that cushion the joints. The patient's symptoms of pain in the anterior thigh could be due to inflammation of the prepatellar bursa, located in front of the knee joint. Bursitis is often caused by overuse or repetitive motion and can also be associated with aging, rheumatoid arthritis, or gout.

+3. Tendinitis: Tendinitis is the inflammation of the tendons, which are the thick bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones. The patient's symptoms could be due to inflammation of the quadriceps or adductor tendons, which attach to the front of the thigh bone. Tendinitis is often caused by overuse or repetitive motion and can also be associated with aging or degenerative changes in the tendons.

+4. Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that affects the cartilage that cushions the joints. While the patient's symptoms are not typical of osteoarthritis, it is possible that the pain in the anterior thigh could be referred pain from the hip joint. Osteoarthritis is more common in older adults and can be associated with joint stiffness, pain, and decreased range of motion.

+5. Referred Pain: Referred pain is pain that is felt in a different location than the site of the injury or disease. The patient's symptoms of pain in the anterior thigh could be due to a problem in the lower back or hip joint that is being referred to the thigh. Referred pain is often described as a dull, aching pain that is not localized to a specific area.

+6. Deep Vein Thrombosis: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms in the deep veins of the leg. While the patient's symptoms are not typical of DVT, it is possible that the pain in the anterior thigh could be due to a blood clot in the femoral vein. DVT is often associated with risk factors such as immobility, recent surgery, cancer, or hormonal therapy.

In summary, the patient's symptoms of pain in both thighs could be due to a variety of causes, including muscle strain, bursitis, tendinitis, osteoarthritis, referred pain, or deep vein thrombosis. Further diagnostic testing, such as imaging studies or blood tests, may be required to confirm the exact diagnosis."

+1. Upper respiratory infection (URI): The patient has symptoms of a catarrhal picture, including fever and a dry, hacking cough. URI is a common infection that affects the upper respiratory tract and can cause symptoms such as sore throat, runny nose, and cough.

+2. Bronchitis: The patient's symptoms of a persistent cough and fever, along with the auscultation findings of normal breath sounds and no crackles, suggest bronchitis as a potential diagnosis. Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, which can cause symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath.

+3. Pneumonia: Although the patient's auscultation findings do not suggest pneumonia, the recent use of antibiotics and the presence of fever and cough warrant consideration of this diagnosis. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause symptoms such as cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing.

+4. Asthma: The patient's history of using a bronchodilator and the recent episode of coughing and vomiting suggest asthma as a potential diagnosis. Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that can cause symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.

+5. Croup: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and dysphonia suggest croup as a potential diagnosis. Croup is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the upper airway, leading to symptoms such as stridor, cough, and difficulty breathing.

The patient's symptoms do not suggest the following diseases:

- Myocardial infarction
- Pulmonary embolism
- Meningitis
- Sepsis
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Urinary tract infection
- Gastroenteritis
- Malignancy

Please note that this list is not exhaustive, and a proper diagnosis should be made by a healthcare professional after a thorough examination and testing.

+1. Cervicalgia of insidious onset: This is a general term for neck pain without a known cause. The patient is a 46-year-old woman with no history of trauma, and she has been experiencing cervicalgia for an unspecified duration.

+2. Cervical spondylosis: This is a degenerative condition that affects the spinal discs and joints in the neck. It is more common in older adults, but it can occur in middle-aged individuals. The patient's age and the absence of trauma make this a possible diagnosis.

+3. Myofascial pain syndrome: This is a chronic pain disorder that affects the muscles and the fascia (the connective tissue that surrounds the muscles). The patient's report of pain localized to the trapezius muscles and the absence of other symptoms support this diagnosis.

+4. Cervical disc herniation: This occurs when the soft, gel-like center of a spinal disc bulges or ruptures, putting pressure on nearby nerves. The patient's age and the absence of trauma make this a possible diagnosis, but it would need to be confirmed with imaging studies.

+5. Whiplash: This is a type of neck injury that occurs when the head is suddenly jerked forward and then backward. Although the patient denies trauma, it is possible that she may have experienced a minor whiplash injury that she is not aware of.

+6. Tension headache: This is a common type of headache that is often caused by muscle tension in the neck and scalp. The patient's cervicalgia may be a symptom of an underlying tension headache.

+7. Fibromyalgia: This is a chronic pain disorder that affects the muscles and soft tissues throughout the body. The patient's age and the absence of other symptoms support this diagnosis, but it would need to be confirmed with further testing.

It is important to note that the patient's symptoms do not suggest any life-threatening conditions. However, a proper diagnosis and treatment plan should be established to alleviate her discomfort and prevent any potential complications."

Rx torax: infiltrados en base derecha. Senos costofrenicos libres., Evolucion: NaN"," Based on the information provided, I will list some potential diseases that could match the patient's symptoms and test results. Keep in mind that I am an AI language model, and my suggestions should not replace a proper medical diagnosis. The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a 7-day history of sore throat, cough with chest discomfort, hoarseness, headache, fatigue, and muscle pain. She has no shortness of breath, fever, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Examination reveals a normal breathing rate, normocolored and well-hydrated skin, and an afebrile patient. The throat is red without exudates or plaques, and there are crackles in the right base and middle fields on auscultation. A SARS-CoV-2 antigen test is negative.

Here are some potential diseases:

+1. Acute Bronchitis:
The patient's symptoms, such as cough, chest discomfort, and hoarseness, are consistent with acute bronchitis. However, the absence of fever and shortness of breath makes this less likely.

+2. Pharyngitis:
The patient's sore throat and red throat on examination suggest pharyngitis. However, the absence of exudates makes streptococcal pharyngitis less likely.

+3. Influenza:
The patient's symptoms of cough, fatigue, muscle pain, and headache are consistent with influenza. However, the negative SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and the absence of fever make this less likely.

+4. Rhinosinusitis:
The patient's symptoms of a 7-day cough and headache, along with the infiltrates on chest X-ray, could suggest a complication of rhinosinusitis.

+5. Community-Acquired Pneumonia:
The patient's symptoms of cough, chest discomfort, and infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest community-acquired pneumonia. The absence of fever and shortness of breath makes this less likely, but it is still a possibility.

+6. Atypical Pneumonia:
The patient's symptoms of cough, chest discomfort, and infiltrates on chest X-ray could also suggest atypical pneumonia, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydophila pneumoniae.

The patient's complete blood count (CBC) shows mild anemia, normal leukocytes with a slightly elevated neutrophil count, and a normal platelet count. The biochemistry results show a slightly elevated glucose level, normal creatinine, urea, sodium, and potassium levels, and a markedly elevated C-reactive protein level. These results suggest a possible bacterial infection, which could support the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia or atypical pneumonia. However, further testing, such as a sputum culture or a serological test, would be needed to confirm the diagnosis."

Please note that this is not a definitive diagnosis, and further examination and testing are necessary for accurate diagnosis.

1. +1. Nursemaid's elbow (Radial head subluxation)
Patient is a 12-year-old female with no significant medical history who presents with pain on the border of the cubital region, specifically at the radio-humeral joint, during paddle activities. Nursemaid's elbow is a common injury in children, but it is less common in older children and adolescents. The patient's age and the localized nature of the pain make this a potential diagnosis.
2. +2. Elbow sprain
The patient's symptoms of pain in the elbow during paddle activities could indicate an elbow sprain. A sprain occurs when the ligaments that connect bones become stretched or torn. This could be the result of repetitive strain or a sudden injury.
3. +3. Osteochondritis dissecans
Osteochondritis dissecans is a joint condition that occurs when a piece of cartilage and bone in a joint, such as the elbow, becomes detached. This can cause pain, swelling, and locking of the joint. The patient's age and the localized nature of the pain make this a potential diagnosis.
4. +4. Lateral epicondylitis (Tennis elbow)
Lateral epicondylitis, also known as tennis elbow, is a condition that causes pain on the outside of the elbow. It is often caused by repetitive strain or overuse. While this condition is more common in adults, it can occur in adolescents who participate in activities that involve repetitive arm movements.
5. +5. Medial epicondylitis (Golfer's elbow)
Medial epicondylitis, also known as golfer's elbow, is a condition that causes pain on the inside of the elbow. It is often caused by repetitive strain or overuse. While this condition is more common in adults, it can occur in adolescents who participate in activities that involve repetitive arm movements.

The patient is a 50-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with a complaint of vomiting for 8 hours, without fever but with chills. The physical examination and laboratory results show the following:

+1. Gastroenteritis: The patient presented with vomiting, which is a common symptom of gastroenteritis. However, the absence of fever and the normal white blood cell count do not support this diagnosis.

+2. Acute gastritis: The patient's symptoms could be due to acute gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. The absence of abdominal pain and tenderness, however, makes this diagnosis less likely.

+3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's normal vital signs, absence of abdominal pain, and normal physical examination make this diagnosis unlikely.

+4. Metabolic disorders: The patient's normal electrolytes and creatinine make metabolic disorders such as diabetic ketoacidosis or uremia less likely.

+5. Gastric outlet obstruction: The patient's normal physical examination and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

+6. Intracranial processes: The patient's normal neurological examination and the absence of headache make intracranial processes such as meningitis or encephalitis unlikely.

+7. Acute appendicitis: The patient's normal physical examination and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

+8. Inflammatory bowel disease: The patient's normal physical examination and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

+9. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's normal physical examination and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

+10. Pancreatitis: The patient's normal amylase and lipase make this diagnosis unlikely.

Based on the patient's laboratory results, there are some notable findings:

* The patient has a mild leukocytosis with a left shift, which could indicate an inflammatory process.
* The patient has a mild anemia, which could be due to chronic disease or blood loss.
* The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, which could indicate liver inflammation or injury.

Given the patient's presentation and laboratory results, some potential diagnoses to consider include:

+11. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient's symptoms of vomiting could be due to regurgitation of stomach contents. The absence of abdominal pain and tenderness makes this diagnosis more likely.

+12. Esophagitis: The patient's symptoms of vomiting and mild anemia could be due to inflammation of the esophagus.

+13. Peptic ulcer disease: The patient's symptoms of vomiting could be due to a gastric or duodenal ulcer. The absence of abdominal pain and tenderness makes this diagnosis less likely.

+14. Medication-induced vomiting: The patient's history of being a physician in the emergency department raises the possibility of medication-induced vomiting.

In conclusion, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of GERD or esophagitis. Further evaluation with an upper endoscopy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment."
